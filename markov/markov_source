For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
Blue Sky Espresso is our darkest coffee offering. It's great for those seeking a low acidity coffee for either espresso or filter brewing.
Blue Sky Espresso hasa distinct Southern Italian profile.
Here are the parameters that we've been using with Blue Sky Espresso(parameters for an 18g VST Precision Filter Basket)
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
There are many beautiful coffees hiding in Valle del Cauca, and Rubiels is especially great. Hes been delivering lots to our exporter partners for the last two and a half years, and each lot has been consistent: sweet, clean, with delicious fruit flavours. This year, we get to have quite a bit of his production, and hopefully even more next harvest.
Castillo has become synonymous with Colombia in the past few decades, with most of the countrys five hundred thousand producer families getting incentive to switch their original Caturra or other varieties to Castillo - a hearty Catimor hybrid with various strains developed by the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation. This made for a switch en masse, making for the fastest and largest change in varieties that coffee has ever seen in a single country. Whatever particular strain Rubiel has, its working for him.
This years La Montaa is complex - Sweet and floral with peach acidity, and flavours of orange, vanilla and soft refreshing cardamom in the finish.
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
Our coffee is decaffeinated at the Descafecol plant in Manizales, Colombia by using a specialized "combination procedure" utilizing water and ethyl acetate derived from sugar cane molasses. Ethyl acetate is an ester that is found naturally in several fruits and vegetables and Manizales is known for its many sugar cane plantations, making great use of a local product. Ethyl acetate's low boiling point enables a gentle caffeine extraction from the coffee bean, while pressure or excessive heat treatment are avoided and the natural structure of the green coffee bean cells are retained.
The Los Idolos producers group got together with the desire of obtaining a high income through the sale of high quality coffee. The name Los Idolos, was chosen because of its symbolism and as a way of honouring the region's ancestral origins. So far, the group has focused on standardizing practices and improving their wet mills and drying patios, slowly and steadily increasing quality.
Here are the parameters that we've been using with our latest Decaf Colombia Los Idolos(parameters for an 18g VST Precision Filter Basket)
If you're looking for an incredibly sweet, clean espresso with floral notes and bright acidity, this is definitely for you. Epic is roasted on the lighter side to highlight these characteristics.
Epic Espresso is the culmination of our search for the sweetest and most complex espresso we can create. We work every day to improve it - always looking for the perfect balance of sweetness and acidity.
As of December 1st, Epic Espresso consists of:
Here are the parameters that we've been using with our latest Epic Espresso (parameters for an 18g VST Precision Filter Basket)
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
The region of La Libertad is a place that we cant fully capture - rolling hills turn into the huge sweeping, lush green mountains overlooking the border into the Chiapas region of Mexico. Warm winds sweep in from the Tehuantepec plain, protecting the coffee in the highlands from frost - how nice of Mexico! 
Special coffees grow here. The micro climate and production is exceptional at La Bolsa (which has been in the Vides/ Ovalle family since 1958), but especially the section of the farm that our lot is comprised of. Ventana Grande means big window - the highest elevated part of the farm is entered through a tunnel in the mountain, opening like a window to the Bourbon and Caturra lot that ripens the slowest, and consequently yields the sweetest fruit. It's thefamilys continuous focus on quality, and their sense of social responsibility (they maintain a full school, and access to healthcare for the local community), that make us excited towork with La Bolsa for yet another year.
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
Ramon is producing a small quantity, but high quality coffee on El Cedral mountain, neighbouring El Cielito in Santa Barbara, surrounding Yojoa Lake. Ramon is no stranger to specialty coffee, having been awarded as a finalist in the prestigious Cup of Excellence competition in previous years.
We are excited to share Ramon's coffee as our Holiday Espresso this year. With floral aroma and flavours of orange zest, nuts and ripe pear it was an obvious choice for our holiday feature and has us feeling festive and warm.
Here are the parameters that we've been using with Holiday Espresso(parameters for an 18g VST Precision Filter Basket)
In 2005, Natividad was rewarded with 1st place in the prestigious Cup of Excellence program and has since worked consistently towards maintaining quality and creating a sustainable farm forhimself and his family. 
The area of El Cielito is close to the micro regions of El Cedral, Las Flores and El Sauce where we work with several producers of similar size and quality as Natividad. Since last year, Natividads focus has been on maintaining quality through a period of growth on his farm, with additional Pacas plots coming into full production. There arent many smallholder farmers we know who take as much care over cash flow and finance to support both quality of life and the coffee when operating a farm of this size (5 hectares at this point) - Its inspiring and encouraging to see, and it translates in part to why we look forward to this coffee every year. We know its going to be good.
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
Martir has a stunning looking crop this year, much of it Yellow Catuai, a variety that is more difficult to pick than its red version of this cultivar. In order for yellow catuai to be deemed ripe, it must be yellow but with a small pink blush, indicating there are lots of sugars in the fruit, ready to be picked and processed.
Martirs main goals for this past season has revolved around first ripe picking, and then maintaining the drying protocols we worked on together last season. Together in February-March 2014, we collaborated on a modest study related to drying the coffee and shelf life of the finished exportable green coffee. We monitored a portion of his production at specific times over the entire drying cycle, and recorded relative humidity and temperature inside the dryer. The dryers were retrofit to help provide some shade during times of hot and bright midday sun. This helped to preserve the quality of the harvest.
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
Karimikui is part of a trio of factories located along the southern slopes of Mount Kenya. More often than not, Kirinyaga as a region has been in the shadow of the legendary Nyeri county - that is clearly no longer the case.
The Rungeto cooperative was created back in 1953, and between Karimikui, and the other two factories involved in the society, the yields and quality are so great that it stands as an excellent example of a cooperative society doing well.
We are excited to release this smooth and balanced coffee as a single origin espresso.
Here are the parameters that we've been using with Kenya Karimikui AA(parameters for an 18g VST Precision Filter Basket)
At the foothills of the Aberdare mountain range, the catchment area of Kigwandi has fantastic growing conditions. Loamy claysoil, 1700 - 1800 meters above seal level where the coffee is grown,and with massive biodiversity as the altitude increase to over 4000 meters at the summit.
Kigwandi began work as a cooperative with the 1982/83 harvestalliedwith the Tetu co-op society.Kigwandi eventually left the Tetu cooperative society to form Mutheka Farmer's Cooperative society in 2004 along with other well performing factories like neighbouring Chorongi.
Possibly the most vibrantamongour Kenyan releases this year, Kigwandi oozes juicy raspberry with theacidity and sweetness of a fresh wildflower honey and rosehip. So good.
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
This is a tribute to traditional espresso. Pacific North West Style.
Old School Espresso is roasted in the medium/dark range to highlight the sweetness and body in the coffee.
Old School Espresso is ideal for those who prefer low acidity and full body. Dark chocolate aroma with round flavours of cocoa, caramel and molasses.
As of November 20th, 2015 Old School Espresso consists of:
Here are the parameters that we've been using with our latest Old School Espresso (parameters for an 18g VST Precision Filter Basket):
Our Organic French Roast is ideal for those who prefer the taste of dark roasted coffee.
This dark roast coffee highlights a smoky, powerful, and spicy flavour. This heavy coffee will delight with a nutty and caramel aftertaste. The low acidity of this rich coffee is perfect for stove top espresso or as filter coffee.
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:

Swiss Water Process involves first soaking the coffee in pure water. The green coffee extract that results is then passed through a carbon filter, specifically engineered to filter out the caffeine molecule. The green coffee extract is then introduced to the coffee but without the caffeine. This process is simple in theory, but impressive to execute, since the coffee has to be dried and preserved in an exacting way to ensure the inherent flavour of the coffee remains relatively unscathed.
Great as both a filter, and an espresso, the cup profile is sweet, and subtle with flavours of cocoa, and caramel.
Here are the parameters that we've been using with our latest Swiss Water Process(parameters for an 18g VST Precision Filter Basket)
These coffeesare the result ofnearly thousands of samples cupped, and many miles logged. It's the result of multi year commitments by producers to grow, pick, and process exciting coffees. Enjoy!

This Decaf is from Kenya. The Swiss Water Process uses only pure "flavor charged water" and a charcoal filtering system to remove caffeine from green coffee beans. The beans are first soaked in very hot water and caffeine is leached out of the beans' cellular material. The solution is then passed through a carbon filter with a porosity specifically sized to capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through. The Swiss Water Process is certified organic and 100% chemical free. In addition, they are also certified Kosher by the Kosher Overseers Association.
Throughout the chain of coffee, each party involved relies on relationships that build each others well being, business, and create security and longevity. Even though we make great efforts to be involved in the entire process of our coffees, its the folks we partner with along the way that really get us a raw product of the quality and ethical caliber we require. Throughout the past five years, weve been really lucky to grow with some awesome folks in Costa Rica through our exporter, Exclusive Coffees. Heslar de Zarcero is a micro mill in the West Valley region and a key link in the chain for a few of the coffees we buy.
Ricardo Prez Barrantes and brothers Marvin and Felipe Rodriguez established Helsar de Zarcero about 12 years ago. The mill began as a way for the three to process coffees from their own farms, and later evolved to become a service for other producers in the West Valley region to create their own micro lots. The micro mill is an essential part of increasing a producers access to quality development, the specialty market, and higher prices. A mill is also a huge investment for a small producernot only does it take money to build, it requires a new skill set with a learning curve and risk. Helsar saw an opportunity to build the micro mill revolution and community in their area by offering a service to other producers growing great coffee, but lacked the means to create their own lots.
Helsar functions like a family. The group of about 40 producers is a tight network, but its not a coop. For the most part, each producers lots are processed separately so that they may create micro lots to sell to buyers that consist of their coffee alone. Scheduled days and times are allotted to each producer to bring cherry to the Helsar mill to be processed. Most of the coffee is fully washed, but Helsar is also experimenting with some honey processed coffees on drying beds, and a newly built facility for producing cascaraa fruit tea made from the pulp, or skin of the coffee cherry. (More to come on this later!)
Dogwood currently buys coffee from two producers in the Helsar de Zarcero familyNereo Ramirez and Eliomar Lopez. Nereo is one of our oldest relationships, weve bought his entire crop since his first year with Helsar and our first year as a coffee company. He had already been farming coffee for more than a decade before working with Helsar, selling his unprocessed cherry to larger buyers for small differentials. During our first trip to Costa Rica almost five years ago, Nereos coffee stood out to us on the cupping table. The coffee always has great sweetness and balancewe think its a perfect everyday coffee without being boring (because who wants every day to be boring? We want our days to be in balance.) It has been awesome to have a long-standing relationship with someone in coffee who starting taking chances at the same time we did. Last year, we added an additional premium on to our price to help him improve and expand his business. Nereo, his wife Elida and other members of their family pick all the coffee themselves instead of hiring outside help. He grows almost all Villa Sarchi variety, which is a Bourbon mutation that originated in Costa Rica.
The second Helsar relationship weve added over the past couple years is Eliomar Lopez. This is our third harvest buying coffee from Eliomar. Hes been farming coffee since 2005 and joined up with Helsar about four years later. His farm is mostly Caturra variety, but hes been building plots of other varieties like Typica and Orange Bourbon.     Nereo and Eliomars farms are very closejust minutes away from each other in the same micro region of Llano Bonito de Naranjo, but the cupprofiles couldnt be more different. In the past weve offered these coffees one after another, but we thought it would be fun to have both of our coffees from Helsar de Zarcero side by side. Nereos coffee is heavier in body, with lower toned cherry cola and cocoa notes. Eliomars coffee has more delicate characteristics and lighter flavors like apricot and white tea.
It should also be noted that Helsar is home to some of the nicest dogs in coffee.Check out our current coffees from Helsar de Zarcero, and stay tunedfor news on our upcoming cascara offering!

This blog is brought to you by David Fasman, our barista trainer.
As I crossed the border into Jordan, a small souvenir shop was to my right, directly across from the border patrol office. The shop was more of a shack, in that it didnt have a front wall and there were holes randomly scattered in the other walls. The shop was full of cheap merchandise and nothing particularly caught my eye. That is until I saw an elderly gentleman near the back of the store, wearing an eye-patch, sitting on a stool, next to a wood fire, moving some sort of pitcher with a long handle in and out of the flames, with some intense concentration. Needless to say, I was intrigued; and not because of the indoor fire or one eyed barista, but the brew method. Id never seen Turkish Coffee prepared before.
I approached the man to investigate and as I got close he looked at me and said, Coffee? Being 7:15am, and on our way to Petra for a long day trip, I happily obliged. He said, One Shekel, which is approximately $0.25. I gave the man a dollar and told him to keep the change. He proceeded to pour six ounces of thick liquid into a small Styrofoam cup. I looked in the cup and noticed a large amount of sediment. I allowed for it to settle, and in the end, there was about three ounces of liquid and three ounces of sludge. I was slightly put off (as I had never had Turkish Coffee before) but everything changed when I stuck my nose in the cup.
The most beautiful and intense aroma wafted out of the cup:a sweet aroma, with notes of coffee, cardamom, and cinnamon. It was like nothing Id ever smelled. And after I took my first sip, it was like nothing Id tasted either. It was the most incredible balance of all of the flavors I noted. It made me wonder how he was able to make such an exquisite beverage. And then it made me wonder how many other brew methods existed around the world that produced delicious coffee that I hadnt tried yet. The drink I had that day was my aha moment with coffee and is the inspiration for the Turkish Latte.
Cardamom and cinnamon were some of the earliest flavor pairings with coffee and after tasting them together it is easy to see why. Its like the flavors were meant to be together. The Turkish Latte is espresso and steamed milk, prepared with a cardamom and cinnamon simple syrup that we make in house. Not overly sweet, it is the perfect balance of coffee, cardamom, cinnamon, and sugar. We hope this drink can help facilitate acoffee aha moment for youand help spread the joy of the holidays to everyone.

This past week, we were lucky enough to co-host a coffee dinner at the Missouri History Museum. We partnered with Butler's Pantry and served a 5 course dinner to 40 friends and guests at Bixby's restaurant in the History Museum. After dinner, guests were treated to a private tour of Coffee: The World in Your Cup & St. Louis in Your Cup(which, if you haven't seen, you should totally go check out).
Huge thanks to the team at Bixby's, the History Museum, and all the guests that made this possible.

Two years ago, we started a new tradition with our holiday coffee, combining two very different and complex coffees from Sumatra and Ethiopia. For this years blend, we have once again selected two of the finest coffees Sumatra and Ethiopia have to offer. We have also teamed up once again with the Firecracker Press to handle the packaging of this coffee. We've partnered with them since we started offering this coffee, and once again, they've done a phenomenal job with it.
This years Ethiopian component of the blend is a naturally processed coffee grown near the town of Kilenso Moconissa of the Sidama region. This complex coffee adds plenty of dark fruit notes to the blend, such as blackberry and blueberry. 
The Sumatran component comes from the famed Aceh region in northern Sumatra. Here the coffees are picked at peak ripeness and then processed in the wet hull method that has made Sumatra famous for their flavor profile. This years coffee adds plenty of depth with notes of vanilla, oak, and some herbal notes. 
Together, these coffees create our version of one of the worlds original coffee blends, Mocha Java. It's a great opportunity for us to share our passion of sourcing and roasting the best coffees in the world. Each year, we are taken with this blends combination of acidity and body that seems to perfectly accompany the spirit of the season. We love sharing our passion for coffee and bringing people together for the holidays. We hope this coffee does just that.
We are also excited to announce that this year, we will be featuring our 'Tis the Season Roast as espressoin our stores during the month of December. The 'Tis the Season will replace our single origin offering in the hoppers. We can't wait for you to try it.
Part of thispackaging was made with Kona Paper, a 100% recycled post-consumer waste product. It is a blend of repurposed coffee bean bag fiber combined with post-consumer waste material.

In order to ensure that you get the freshest coffee possible when ordering through our website, we will be changing how we do it a little bit starting October 26.
The new ordering / shipping schedule is as follows:
If you order before noon on Monday - Thursday, your order will ship out the next day.
If you order after noon on Monday - Thursday, your order will ship out two days later.
For instance, if you order at 9am on a Monday, your order will ship out on Tuesday. However, if you order at 5pm on a Monday, your order will ship out Wednesday.
If your order Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, at any time, your order will ship out on Monday.
This change will be in practice as of Monday, October 26.

This post was written by Matt Foster. Matt isa barista and team lead at our Kayak's location and has ledthe training and change to Firepot Nomadic Teasin our retail stores.
Kaldis Coffee is proud to present an all new line of teas that focuses on direct purchasing, exceptional quality, authentic tastes, and ethical practices. Original founder Sarah Scarborough has spent the last 15 years immersed in the world of tea. Shes traveled to gardens all over the world, developed relationships with tea artisans, growers and producers, and marketed her own award winning chai recipe all along the way. Now based in Nashville TN, Firepot has partnered with us to bring you 8 loose leaf teas, 3chai varieties, and a brand new outlook on what tea can be.
All of our teas are available for purchase at our cafes, and for the best experience, order one to stay. Weve developed a unique open steeping method and individual recipes that allow us to focus on each of the following important factors to ensure all of the aromas and flavors the teas possess make it to your cup each and every time.
Space: In order for tea leaves to infuse their flavors fully and evenly they need ample room to unfurl. We steep our teas in our branded beakers and these provide the leaves all the room they need.
Dose: We weigh out a precise amount of tea, depending on which one we are steeping, and always use 16 oz. of water.
Temperature: To ensure we dont burn the more delicate leaves we adjust our water temperatures by combining room temperature water with boiling water. We also check the temperature each and every time before using it.
Time: Our custom made tea boards have timers placed right under where your tea steeps, so well be sure your tea never becomes bitter or astringent.
We couldnt be prouder to share these amazing teas with everyone and hope to see you soon at one of our locations for a steeping.
You can find Firepot online, on Twitter, on Facebook, and on Instagram.

The University of Missouri-Columbia (Mizzou) has played a significant role in the lives of many folks at Kaldi's. When the perfect space (located at the corner of Ninth and Cherry) opened up in 2007, we jumped at the opportunity to open a Kaldi's Coffeehouse in Columbia. Since opening, we've won a number of city-wide awards for our coffee quality and have become a beloved place in the community for coffee, food, and studying. We hope to be a part of many more Mizzou memories in the years ahead. Favorites include our award winning Espresso 700 and fresh fruit smoothies.

We bought our first roaster in 1995, set it up in the front window of our DeMun Coffeehouse, and started roasting the best coffees we'd ever tasted. Over the years, we've learned quite a bit more about this delicate process and we're happy to say we're still roasting the best coffees we've ever tasted.
The process starts by selecting high-quality green (unroasted) coffees from the world's best farms and co-ops. We then develop a unique roast profile for each coffee based on its taste characteristics, density, and processing type.
Most of the coffees we roast are single origin coffees, meaning they come from one unique farm, mill, or co-op. Our goal when roasting these fine coffees is to accentuate the natural taste components inherent to each coffee. Dark-roasting a single origin coffee typically melts away the character and unique qualities for which we bought the coffee in the first place.
We also blend coffees together to create our signature blends, like Espresso 700 and Caf Kaldi. These coffees are designed to fit a specific taste profile. The blend of coffees used to achieve that taste profile will change slightly throughout the year since coffees are seasonal.
Whether blend or single origin, each coffee is now roasted by one of our experienced coffee roasters using either our 1937 Vintage 75-kilo Probat or our 1960's era 22-kilo Probat. Both roasters are top-of-the-line and feature cast iron pieces for added heat retention and fantastic air flow abilities.
Green (unroasted) coffee is "charged" into the roaster's spinning drum. The drum spins the coffee constantly to avoid it being burned by the bank(s) of natural-gas powered flames that heat it. The roaster is able to add or subtract heat to change the speed at which the coffee is roasted. During every roast, we monitor the temperature of the beans in the drum, the temperature of the exhaust, and gas pressure. By noting the changes in these marks over time, we can make many small adjustments to the gas pressure and air-flow to change a roast profile. Some coffees taste better with a short, fast roast, while others may come out better with a low-and-slow profile.
Our attention to these small details with each coffee we produce is what makes Kaldi's Coffee unique and delicious. We know you'll taste it in the cup.
Kaldis Relationship Coffees offer consumers the opportunity to take a proactive and global approach to their coffee purchasing decisions. Building on the success and wisdom of Fair Trade Certified, Kaldis Relationship Coffees provide even greater transparency into the otherwise complex coffee transaction chain - from coffee grower to coffee lover.
Our philosophy is simple: premium-priced coffees should taste premium. With Kaldis Relationship Coffees, we select with our palates, ensure that our farmer friends are rewarded for their efforts, and that the coffee is grown in a sustainable, ecologically sound manner.
The goals of Kaldis Relationship Coffees are simple:
Kosher foods are selected and prepared in accordance with traditional Jewish ritual and dietary laws. All of Kaldis Coffees are processed under supervision of the Vaad Hoeir of St. Louis, one of the worlds most respected kashrus agencies. While there is nothing inherently un-kosher about coffee in general, we invite a specially trained rabbis inspection of our roasting facility to ensure that our practices conform to the highest standards of cleanliness and purity. That inspection permits Kaldis to use the prestigious OV symbol on our packaging  your guarantee that Kaldis Coffee meets that highest standards of cleanliness and kosher conformity. Even if you dont observe kosher dietary prescriptions, these ancient traditions are considered by many to be among the most important food safety conventions in practice. For more information about kosher food, visit www.ovkosher.org.
In 2001, we were one of the first retailers in St. Louis to offer certified Fair Trade Coffees. These coffees are monitored by Fair Trade Federation ensuring that at least a minimum sustainable wage was paid to the co-op at origin that exported the coffee. The Fair Trade minimum changes occasionally to reflect the economies and conditions at origin. We are happy to say that we have always and will always be paying at least this much for all of our coffees, and continue to improve upon the movement Fair Trade has started.
Over the last few years, we have started focusing on new programs (see Kaldis Relationship Coffees) that reward quality and taste as well as help small farmers who may not qualify for Fair Trade certification. These coffees are typically produced by small, independent farmers and co-ops who have started to build value based on the quality of their coffee rather than a certification.
Kaldis is a Certified Organic handler and processor of organic coffees and goods, meaning we buy and sell organic coffees and teas that have been grown without the use of harmful chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. In addition, and what most never realize, is that we follow a tedious and carefully-monitored set of specific operations when handling and packaging organic coffees and teas. Only then, when we follow these operations and pass our audits, can our coffee be offered as Certified Organic. Feel free to learn more via the USDA or through our certifying agent, Quality Assurance International.

When you place an order from us, our highest priority is sending you the freshest coffee possible. You deserve it, and frankly so do our world class coffee producers and their coffees.
If you order before noon on Monday - Thursday, your order will ship out the next day.
If you order after noon on Monday - Thursday, your order will ship out two days later.
For instance, if you order at 9am on a Monday, your order will ship out on Tuesday. However, if you order at 5pm on a Monday, your order will ship out Wednesday.
If your order Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, at any time, your order will ship out on Monday.
We ship flat rate USPS Priority Mail (or FedEx) for $2.95 on all orders under $50. Shipping is free for orders over $50!USPS Priority Mail does not guarantee a certain delivery time, but is good at hitting the delivery times provided by the map below.Generally, if you live within the continental United States you will get your order within three days.
We also can ship internationally and rush ship orders through FedEx.
When do orders ship?When you place an order from us, our highest priority is sending you the freshest coffee possible. If you place an order Monday through Thursday, we will ship your order the following day; Orders placed on Friday will ship out the following Monday. This is to ensure the coffee we are sending you is as fresh as possible.
How to store coffee:There is great debate on whether to store coffee in the freezer, pantry, etc. Our recommendations are to store your coffee in a dry, cool, dark, and airtight place. Exposure to oxygen degrades coffee quicker and storing it outside of your freezer will ensure any neighboring ingredients dont impose their flavor on your coffee.
Does coffee have an expiration date?Coffee doesnt expire, but we recommend buying coffee as often as you buy your milk, bread, and eggs (so about every two weeks or so). Stocking up on large amounts of whole bean coffee will lead to coffee being used further away from its roast date. The sooner you brew coffee from when it was roasted, the fresher it is and the better it will taste.
Fair Trade Coffee:We have a selection of Fair Trade coffees available year round on our blends page. Sometimes, our single origin coffees will have a Fair Trade certification. All coffees we buy are bought at or above current Fair Trade prices. Our Kaldis Relationship Coffees are coffees with which we have a direct relationship with the coffee producer. We select coffees with our palates, ensure that our farmer friends are rewarded for their efforts, and that the coffee is grown in a sustainable, ecologically sound manner
Return Policy:We dont accept any whole bean coffee returns, but we'll happily replace your coffee with another selection should you not enjoy your purchase. Any merchandise bought from our website can be returned to our roasting facility within 30 days for a full refund. Please note our cafes cannot accept returns for online purchases. For more individual assistance on this, please email us at roastmaster@kaldiscoffee.com.
What is the strongest/boldest/lightest coffee you have?Taste is very subjective. Equating roast profiles to flavor intensity only applies if you enjoy the flavor imposed on the coffee by its roast profile. For example: dark roasted coffees dont necessarily have a stronger or bolder taste. When we roast our coffees, our goal is to bring out the inherent flavor of the green coffee we buy. Thats why our single origin coffees are all considered a light roast. We dont want the roast profile to impose a taste on the coffee, but bring out those great, unique qualities.
What do your flavor notes mean?Taste descriptions on our non-flavored coffees are notes that we found were most prevalent within that unique coffee and can be used as a guide on notes you may experience when brewing. None of these coffees are flavored in any way, but should be thought of as taste experiences you would find outside of coffee. For example, Ethiopian coffees tend to have a light, tea-like drinking experience, but Central American coffees generally have a nutty-like sweetness. Your experience and taste notes you pick up on will likely be different than ours and you should use our notes as a guide to choose coffees you think you would enjoy.
Why isnt my favorite coffee being offered right now?Coffee is a seasonal crop and when we choose to offer coffees, we buy them at the peak of their season. Coffee crops by region vary throughout the year, so African coffees will be offered at different times than South American coffees. We only offer the best, so our current selection is among the highest quality coffees we could find at this given time.
What coffee is in your blends?When we create a blend, we choose coffees that fit a unique taste profile. Since coffee is seasonal, were constantly adjusting and modifying each blend to match that taste profile based on the coffees we currently have in stock. The taste of each blend should remain consistent year round, but you may notice some subtle differences from time-to-time.
Can I taste your coffee forfree?Yes. We host a free weekly cupping at our roasting facility every Friday at 2p (holidays and some Fridays excluded) including a quick tour of our roasting facility. A coffee cupping is very similar to a wine tasting in that you will try a variety of coffees in a short amount of time. It is led by our roasting crew and a cupping is the same way we and coffee professionals evaluate coffees for purchase around the world. We'd love to have you visit us.How should I brew my coffee?There are a variety of exciting ways to brew coffee, all of which bring out unique qualities within you coffee. No matter how you brew your coffee, there are some standards that you should follow to get the best cup of coffee. We have guides for specific brewing methods available for download here.

Cupping notes : DeepSmokiness,Browned Butter,Caramel
Roast level : Dark
We choose the coffees for this blend for their ability to be enhanced by a deep, dark roast. This allows for intense flavors such as bakers chocolate, sweet graham cracker and aromatic, cedar-like wood to accompany rich smokiness in both flavor and aroma. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel and low acidity allow this intensely flavorful coffee to both counter and complement rich desserts or a fresh baked morning pastry.

To drink a cup of Ethiopia Nigusse Lemma is to connect with the origins of coffee. Beans from Ethiopias Limu woreda (district) deliver unique flavors that can only be discovered in heirloom varietals. Located in the southwestern part of country, Limu is not as well known as Yirgacheffe or Harrar, but deserves the attention that it is receiving.
Our Ethiopia Niguisse Lemma is sourced from the family farm of Lemma Edeto and is located in the highest elevations of the Limu region. Shade from old growth trees, water from spring fed stream, and native varietal of coffee that flourish organically are in no better hands than the Edeto Family. Lemma, with over 60 years in the coffee industry, has passed down the knowledge to his sons Nigusse and Haile, who operate the farm which their father recovered after it was confiscated by the Derg regime in the 1970s. The familys commitment to quality includes a fully natural dry processing that insures no unripend cherries taint the taste of the finished product. Fully control from farming to milling has resulted in award-winning coffee. Nigusse and family were recently honored for the African Taste of the Harvest competition awarded by the African Fine Coffee Association.

For more than a century, Las Nubes (the clouds) Estate has been a known producer of some of the finest coffee in Guatemala. We are proudly offering beans from its Pecul Lotpecul meaning small in the local language and referring to the size of this exquisite lot comprised of Bourbon, Typica and Caturra beans.
Finca Las Nubes, located in San Francisco Zapotitlan about 25 miles west of Lake Atitlan, is situated in the higher elevations of the Suchitepequez Region, sitting at just under 6,000 feet. Along with coffee, Las Nubes is also well-known for its nature reserve, providing a wooded sanctuary to several species of birds, including the Quetzal, national bird of Guatemala.
But perhaps as notable as its coffee and nature reserve are the evocative photographs of the farm, circa 1875, as taken by famed photographer Eadweard Muybridge. The circumstances that landed Muybridge to Guatemala were dubious, following a story of adultery and justifiable homicide. However, his series of Las Nubes photographs beautifully documented coffee farming of the era and instantly immortalized the farm at a period soon after it was established.
Youre sure to enjoy this lively coffee that holds up to its historyPeculopens up with vibrant flavors of wild strawberries and red plumsand isfollowed by an elegantbrown sugar finish.

Lintong coffee, like the majority of Sumatran coffee, is processed using a method that is regionally distinct in its preparation. The process begins normally, where the bean is removed from the cherry, fermented and processed to remove the sticky mucilage. The difference is that instead of allowing the remaining bean to dry to a point of stability before removing the final parchment layer, the bean is removed from the parchment much sooner,resulting in a moisture level that is two to three times higher than normal. The result is a bean that has a dark jade color and unmistakable profile.
This coffee opens up with a fragrance that reminds us of a forest floor and is followed by rich, low notes that allude to fresh tobacco leaf and English Breakfast, complemented by a gentle grapefruit acidity.

My love affair with coffee goes back to my hometown of Salerno, Italy, where as a young man, I worked for the Nestler Coffee Roasting Plant.
The proprietor, a master of coffee roasting, made me his protg. With great generosity and personal pride he taught me all his skills, from bean selection to blending. Most importantly, he taught me his method of roasting with Oak Wood.
When I came to America I discovered there where few places I could get a good espresso. I saw this as an opportunity to implement all my skills in coffee roasting and founded Mr. Espresso in 1978.
I happily bring to America the tradition of wood roasted coffee. I hope you enjoy!
My father, Carlo, was the second youngest of seven brothers and sisters raised by a single mother in the Southern Italian town of Salerno, during World War II and its aftermath.
He married my mother, Marie Francoise, who was from the coastal region of Normandy, France and the daughter of a French baker. They lived in Paris where he began a career in the elevator industry and where my sister Laurence (Laura) and brother John were born. Following in the footsteps of his older brother Franco, he immigrated to the United States, seeking a better life for his family. His brother Franco had studied at CAL Berkeley and openedthe Villanova, one of the first successful Italian restaurants in the East Bay.
Upon his arrival, my father continued his work at Otis Elevators and found a home in Alameda. In 1977 I, the youngest son and the first American of the family, was born.
At that time in the United States, very little was known about espresso, let alone espresso equipment. It would not be inaccurate to say that few Americans had ever even drank an espresso, and even fewer knew the intricacies of how to make one. But as Italian culture began to permeate the Bay Area from epicenters such as San Franciscos North Beach, my father identified the necessity to bridge the gap between my familys past and what is now my familys future: to popularize excellent espresso as imperative to a good meal.
With a strong electrical and mechanical background, he approached his contacts in Italy and purchased a few espresso machines for direct import to our Alameda home. In 1978, with nothing but a brochure in hand and his word, he began selling the espresso equipment to Italian restaurateurs across the Bay Area. As a recent immigrant, he was eager to connect the dots between the rich heritage of our collective history and the ever-increasing demand in San Francisco for Italian culture.
His attempts were successful beyond anything he could have imagined. Although meager by todays standards, my fathers few machines played a crucial role in the Bay Areas appreciation of espresso coffee. Our garage became a showroom and a testing center. Our pickup truck became the delivery truck for installations. My brother John began assisting my father as an apprentice as early as age ten. My sister Laurence (Laura) typed brochures at the kitchen table, and I found myself riding along with my mother to make coffee deliveries to our customers. The family had become, in effect, an importer of Italian culture. Upon visiting our showroom in Oakland, you will still see the original shipping crates with our old home address on them, a constant reminder of the companys roots.
One of the companys earliest clients was Caffe Mediterraneum (or The Med as it is more lovingly referred to by its patrons), the first espresso bar in the East Bay, located in Berkeley, California. Boasting the birthplace of the Caf Latte, barista extraordinaire and owner, Lino, purchased a 6-group Aurora lever machine (2-3 times the size of the average Espresso Machine!) to use in his already famous caf.
Naturally, the transition to roasting coffee was inevitable. My father had successfully provided the machines. Now he was intent on providing the espresso. Initially though, he just wanted some good coffee to drink at home. His initial roasting experiments in our kitchen had the neighbors convinced our house had caught fire. Despite their puzzlement, one thing was clear: the coffee was superb.
In 1982 he officially began commercial roasting in tiny batches, roasted for a curious few. His combination of high quality espresso machines and Oak Wood roasted coffee caught on quickly. My fathers clients came to know him as Mr. Espresso and, as you would expect, the name stuck.
Up to that time, espresso was primarily considered an ingredient added to a 16oz glass of steamed milk and it was roasted with primarily one goal, to cut through all that milk. So most of the espresso at that time was roasted very dark, up to the point just before it would catch fire in some cases. My father was one of the first to roast espresso as it was in Italy, as a beverage to be consumed by itself with all the flavor, nuance and complexity of a fine glass of wine.
Mr. Espresso became the roaster of choice for some of the Bay Areas finest cafes and restaurant. Acclaimed chefs such as Alice Waters , Bradley Ogden and Paul Bertolli and distinguished restaurants like Square One and The Baywolf began to take notice. The coffee grew and expanded not only because of its taste, but also because of the story that came with it. At the same time, the story of Mr. Espresso is a reminder of just what it means to be an American. This story is a living example of how our diverse cultural landscape was nourished by the efforts of those eager to share their heritage with the rest of the world.
"The proprietor, a coffee master, made me his protg. Under his generous guidance, I learned the nuances of making the perfect brew; from bean selection to blending. And the holy grail of his philosophy was his family's method of roasting with aged oak."
Mr. Espresso continues to be the Di Ruocco homestead. Carlo and Marie-Francoise can now easily find that elusive espresso with the depth of flavor and quality of their favorite brews while Laurence, John, Luigi and Alex continue to explore.

Today, Mr Espresso has grown into a Bay Area institution  as a quality roaster and an established provider of espresso equipment, service, and training to a sizable share of coffeehouses and restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.
Mr. Espresso continues to be family-owned and operated with two generations of Di Ruoccos working together in the Oakland showroom and roasting facility to ensure that what we began over 30 years ago will endure.
Along with the new generation and keeping with the pace of change in our industry, the old world methods we use are evolved through education and experience. A balance of art versus science is now our goal. Our coffee now has a distinctively Italian American profile, maintaining the emphasis on espresso while rounding out our selection with amazing single origins and blends, at a variety of roasts.
We have seen many trends come and go, and to our knowledge, things have a tendency to work in cycles. Without deviating from the things that have contributed to our success over the years, we are always striving and pursuing new ways towards higher quality and a greater diversity of tastes.
We think youll find that Mr. Espresso strikes that wonderful balance between time honored traditional methods and the emerging trends of the marketplace.
"We are the first and only roaster in the United States to roast coffee beans over a fire fueled exclusively by wood. The differences are not what one might initially expect..."  More on Oak Wood Roasting 
Fresh Cup Magazines Blog takes a look at the magic behind Mr. Espressos Wood-Fired roasting:
In the cup, John says the roasting process presents a more balanced and sweeter cup. It rounds out the edges of espresso, which is why Mr. Espresso has stuck with this labor intensive method. Theres some romanticism to it, of course. Just the idea that this is the way that people used to roast coffee, he says. Maintaining the craft and the artisanship.

Mr. Espresso has now grown to service a large number of local restaurants, including Flour & Water and the Delfina Group. You may recognize Mr. Espresso from the most influential and important Italian restaurants in San Francisco because they offer full-service espresso, that is, the machine, the beans, the service, plus the Italian attitude and fashion sense. Luigi also co-owns Coffee Bar and its three San Francisco locations.Mr. Espresso is still the only game in town that is roasting its beans over an oak wood fire (rather than gas), a process that needs to be consistently monitored and managed by a master roaster to maintain temperature.

Thank you Leif Haven of Sprudge for the great write-up.
Mr. Espresso was instrumental in spreading early espresso culture in the Bay, both with their machines and service, and with the beans they started roasting to supply the (then) new-fangled machines they were bringing in. Carlo Di Ruocco learned the ways of roasting at a traditional wood-fired roastery in Salerno, Italy. Nowadays their roasters useRoastLogsoftware for precise and careful control, but the oak wood has stayed. Luigi Di Ruocco claims that the low, even heat of the wood leads to a slower roastingprocess that makes formore mellow and sweet espresso.

Third Wave coffee has done a good job at closing the door behind it, leaving companies like Peets and that one with the mermaid to seem like lumbering giants better at pushing dark-roast concoctions on malls in Orinda rather cultivating a purer appreciation of coffee. Its patently untrue, of course: Peets was founded in Berkeley, and Blue Bottle clearly hasgalactic-conquest aspirations. But the battle lines are drawn. Small-scale roasteryMr. Espressodoesnt easily map onto them, having been roasting beans over oak in Oakland since 1978 for high-end cafes such asCoffee Barand restaurants such as Perbacco or flour + water. I got the chance to look at the facility and glean some wisdom from a family-run business devoted to yielding the perfect Neapolitan cup as flawlessly as any temple to coffee on Valencia Street.

This month theCoffee Review.comconducted a tasting on coffees from Colombia: Colombia 2014: On the Rebound
We recently received and started roasting a new Colombiancoffee from Finca El Bado which we submitted for the review. El Bado is thecurrent record-holder for Cup of Excellence awards in the region with four consecutive top-twenty placements . Were pleased to report that the coffee did very well, and received an outstanding score of 92 points! At $12 per 12 oz bag this coffee offers a tremendous value to the consumer.
See our Single Origin page for more info about this coffee and a direct link for purchase as well. We hope you enjoy!

There were forty-eight competitors total at the Big Western Barista Championships, a regional competition held in Los Angeles for the top barista competitors in the west coast. Twenty one were fighting for the title of North West Champion and twenty seven were battling it out for the coveted title of South West Barista Champion, a region that is widely considered to be the most competitive in the nation. Baristas came from as far as Alaska and Hawaii to test out their espresso skills in the ring of fire.
The competition was held in the up and coming Arts District of L.A. Less than two blocks away from Handsome Coffee Roasters. The event was split between two rooms. The smaller side room held the competitor preparation tables and the Brewers Cup Competition. The main room held the Barista Competition. Approximately 400 guests filled the industrial style Lot 613 to watch the spectacle.
The weather was hot and typical of Southern California. The temperature on stage was magnified by body heat and a skylight placed directly over head. There were 3 competitor stations set side by side with the audience in full view. There was even a balcony with a lounge area if you wanted to brave the heat.
I was the 8th competitor to showcase their coffee on the first day of competition. My coffee of choice was a Guatemalan Guayab Associacion Civil with chewy, chocolaty body, strawberry jamminess, and notes of mulled red wine cider and hibiscus. The judges stares were penetrating and the crowd was supportive. It made for an awkward balance. I performed the routine as practiced a thousand times over with little variance other than a slight hitch towards the end. It was exhilarating.
The training that it took to arrive there was what meant the most to me. Through dedicated research and study I was able to become a more knowledgeable professional on the topic of Guatemalan coffee. From growing practices and processing methods to roasting and extraction, this was a definitive learning experience in my career. I was ableto present a wonderful coffee at the event and that is exactly what I had set out to do, and it was a privilege to share the stage with so many talented baristas. At the end we were able to exchange our coffees with one another and that is what makes the community so wonderful. I look forward to the next time.
Jackie Burrell, Food & Wine Editor with Bay Area News Group, has just launched a new weekly column called Build a Better where chefs, baristas, culinary experts share tips and a quick and simple recipe for building a better _______. Stuff everyone does, but perhaps not really well.
Jackie reached out to us for her column and while making a great cappuccino is not as easy as laid out below, we tried our best to keep it straight forward and simple.
 Here is the column copy and pasted below:
By Jackie Burrell @ Bay Area News Group
There are few things that put a zing in your step as reliably and deliciously as a really good cappuccino, that happy collision of espresso and foamy milk. But, Luigi Di Ruocco says, there are a few tricks to making a really good one. Di Ruocco is the vice president of Oaklands Mr. Espresso, the coffee business his Italian-born father, Carlo, launched in the family garage in 1978, in an era when Folgers and Yuban ruled the demitasse. At first, neighbors thought the Di Ruoccos were setting their house on fire, but that fragrant aroma was the scent of coffee beans roasting. Soon the family was delivering espresso machines to restaurants such as Caffe Mediterraneum  the East Bays fi
rst espresso bar  and supplying chefs such as Alice Waters, Paul Bertolli and Bradley Ogden.
The secret to a great cappuccino?

We think you'll find 
			        that Mr. Espresso strikes the delicate balance between time-honored traditional methods and a burning desire 
			        to advance our craft. The result is a flavor with an Italian passion and soul, comfortably residing within the 
			        Bay Areas culture of specialty coffee 'conoscenti'.
			    

			    	We are the first and only roaster in the United States to roast coffee beans over a fire fueled exclusively by wood.  The differences are not what one might initially expect... More on Oak Wood Roasting 
			   	
A Southern Italian, a Northern Italian, and a North American style blend
Three exceptional light roasted coffees from three different continents
A light roast, a medium roast, and a dark roasted blend

			With each blend, we hope to achieve that unattainable quality, that little something extra that otherwise cannot be found in a coffee.

Cupping notes : DeepSmokiness,Browned Butter,Caramel
Roast level : Dark
We choose the coffees for this blend for their ability to be enhanced by a deep, dark roast. This allows for intense flavors such as bakers chocolate, sweet graham cracker and aromatic, cedar-like wood to accompany rich smokiness in both flavor and aroma. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel and low acidity allow this intensely flavorful coffee to both counter and complement rich desserts or a fresh baked morning pastry.

The most common source of fuel used to supply a coffee roaster with heat is gas. We are, however, the first and only roaster in the United States to roast coffee beans exclusively over a fire fueled by Oak Wood. The differences are not what one might initially expect. Unlike cooking with a wood oven or grill, where the smoke from the wood imparts a flavor to the final product, the main difference between wood and conventional roasting lies in the quality of the heat delivered to the beans. Heat derived from wood has higher moisture content and is better suited for slow roasting.
The more oil preserved within the bean, the more exquisite the final flavor will be. The natural humidity within the wood seems to envelop the beans during the roasting process, hence preserving more of the lipids within. Meanwhile, the slow roasting aspect ensures the coffee is lower in acidity and higher in body. The result is most apparent in our espresso, yielding more crema, fuller flavor, and a smoother finish. For drip coffee for which we actually wish to retain the acidity of the coffees, we subject the beans to a faster roasting time.
The unique advantages of wood roasting do not come without challenges, as the use of such an inconsistent fuel (i.e. wood) creates difficulties in maintaining consistency between roasts. A nightmare for an inexperienced operator, years of experience of roasting with wood are required to develop the intuition and instinct necessary to master the process. Luckily for us, with 30 years of wood roasting under our belt, we are able to claim this as an advantage; since through the unpredictable nature of roasting with wood, we are required to be attentive and obsessive with each and every roast: nothing can replace the skilled guidance of our experienced roasters. However, never the ones to be overconfident, we still go through extra steps to ensure consistency and quality.
We begin by selecting well seasoned wood from responsible suppliers. We then utilize thermocouple data collected at key locations on the roaster along with VFD motor control, which allows to make fan and drum speed adjustments during the roasting process. The wood smoke emissions are then abated by high powered afterburners which are in full compliance with local air quality standards. Combining these tools with our years of experience, we are able to maintain control of the roasting process with a very high level of consistency. As you can see, wood roasting is an artisan craft where human experience using old world methods, combined with the latest technological advances in roasting, delicately blend art and science. We hope you will enjoy a distinctive coffee experience which is impossible to duplicate.

			A great single origin is a truly exceptional coffee that highlights the intrinsic qualities of that region while being able to stand on its own as a unique and enjoyable cup of coffee.

To drink a cup of Ethiopia Nigusse Lemma is to connect with the origins of coffee. Beans from Ethiopias Limu woreda (district) deliver unique flavors that can only be discovered in heirloom varietals. Located in the southwestern part of country, Limu is not as well known as Yirgacheffe or Harrar, but deserves the attention that it is receiving.
Our Ethiopia Niguisse Lemma is sourced from the family farm of Lemma Edeto and is located in the highest elevations of the Limu region. Shade from old growth trees, water from spring fed stream, and native varietal of coffee that flourish organically are in no better hands than the Edeto Family. Lemma, with over 60 years in the coffee industry, has passed down the knowledge to his sons Nigusse and Haile, who operate the farm which their father recovered after it was confiscated by the Derg regime in the 1970s. The familys commitment to quality includes a fully natural dry processing that insures no unripend cherries taint the taste of the finished product. Fully control from farming to milling has resulted in award-winning coffee. Nigusse and family were recently honored for the African Taste of the Harvest competition awarded by the African Fine Coffee Association.

Our Colombian El Diviso microlot, comes from producer Maximino Diaz small farm that sits in the Central Andes at a 6,200 foot elevation. The Tolima region, that is home to Maximino, is experiencing a transformationfrom poverty and violence, due to the Colombian conflict, to a rebounding market for their high quality beans, offering a vehicle of change for its people.
In addition to producing fine coffee beans, Maximino is dedicated to nurturing his land and its wildlife. He not only grows sustenance crops such as maize and beans, he has also created a small nature reserve that provides a nesting site for the Colombian chachalaca. This turkey-like, native bird is not endangered but has seen a continual declining population. It is Maximinos commitment to give back to the land that has been so generous to him.
El Diviso is a complex coffee withcinnamon and milk chocolate aromas, mandarin and meyer lemon acidity andsmooth cashew butter undertones.

For more than a century, Las Nubes (the clouds) Estate has been a known producer of some of the finest coffee in Guatemala. We are proudly offering beans from its Pecul Lotpecul meaning small in the local language and referring to the size of this exquisite lot comprised of Bourbon, Typica and Caturra beans.
Finca Las Nubes, located in San Francisco Zapotitlan about 25 miles west of Lake Atitlan, is situated in the higher elevations of the Suchitepequez Region, sitting at just under 6,000 feet. Along with coffee, Las Nubes is also well-known for its nature reserve, providing a wooded sanctuary to several species of birds, including the Quetzal, national bird of Guatemala.
But perhaps as notable as its coffee and nature reserve are the evocative photographs of the farm, circa 1875, as taken by famed photographer Eadweard Muybridge. The circumstances that landed Muybridge to Guatemala were dubious, following a story of adultery and justifiable homicide. However, his series of Las Nubes photographs beautifully documented coffee farming of the era and instantly immortalized the farm at a period soon after it was established.
Youre sure to enjoy this lively coffee that holds up to its historyPeculopens up with vibrant flavors of wild strawberries and red plumsand isfollowed by an elegantbrown sugar finish.

Lintong coffee, like the majority of Sumatran coffee, is processed using a method that is regionally distinct in its preparation. The process begins normally, where the bean is removed from the cherry, fermented and processed to remove the sticky mucilage. The difference is that instead of allowing the remaining bean to dry to a point of stability before removing the final parchment layer, the bean is removed from the parchment much sooner,resulting in a moisture level that is two to three times higher than normal. The result is a bean that has a dark jade color and unmistakable profile.
This coffee opens up with a fragrance that reminds us of a forest floor and is followed by rich, low notes that allude to fresh tobacco leaf and English Breakfast, complemented by a gentle grapefruit acidity.

The new generation of professional machines for coffee pods. Duetto Lux has been especially designed for large consumptions. It has passed the toughest tests guaranteeing constant coffee quality without inconveniences.
Design, colors, pod closing system, heat-exchanger: these are just a few of the innovations that makes Pinocchio unique within the panorama of espresso coffee-pod machines.
The most common source of fuel used to supply a coffee roaster with heat is gas. We are, however, the first and only roaster in the United States to roast coffee beans exclusively over a fire fueled by Oak Wood. The differences are not what one might initially expect. Unlike cooking with a wood oven or grill, where the smoke from the wood imparts a flavor to the final product, the main difference between wood and conventional roasting lies in the quality of the heat delivered to the beans. Heat derived from wood has higher moisture content and is better suited for slow roasting.
The more oil preserved within the bean, the more exquisite the final flavor will be. The natural humidity within the wood seems to envelop the beans during the roasting process, hence preserving more of the lipids within. Meanwhile, the slow roasting aspect ensures the coffee is lower in acidity and higher in body. The result is most apparent in our espresso, yielding more crema, fuller flavor, and a smoother finish. For drip coffee for which we actually wish to retain the acidity of the coffees, we subject the beans to a faster roasting time.
The unique advantages of wood roasting do not come without challenges, as the use of such an inconsistent fuel (i.e. wood) creates difficulties in maintaining consistency between roasts. A nightmare for an inexperienced operator, years of experience of roasting with wood are required to develop the intuition and instinct necessary to master the process. Luckily for us, with 30 years of wood roasting under our belt, we are able to claim this as an advantage; since through the unpredictable nature of roasting with wood, we are required to be attentive and obsessive with each and every roast: nothing can replace the skilled guidance of our experienced roasters. However, never the ones to be overconfident, we still go through extra steps to ensure consistency and quality.
We begin by selecting well seasoned wood from responsible suppliers. We then utilize thermocouple data collected at key locations on the roaster along with VFD motor control, which allows to make fan and drum speed adjustments during the roasting process. The wood smoke emissions are then abated by high powered afterburners which are in full compliance with local air quality standards. Combining these tools with our years of experience, we are able to maintain control of the roasting process with a very high level of consistency. As you can see, wood roasting is an artisan craft where human experience using old world methods, combined with the latest technological advances in roasting, delicately blend art and science. We hope you will enjoy a distinctive coffee experience which is impossible to duplicate.

We are happy to introduce to you a new group called: "Aromas del Sur located in Palestina, Huila. We are working together with Aromas del Sur to bring to you the best coffees from Palestina.
The founding members created the group in 2013, when they discovered the potential of specialty coffee production. Currently 73 active members compromise Aromas del Sur.
The average farm size is 6 hectares with an altitude range going from 1400 to 1900 masl. The highest farm is located at 1970 masl. The varieties commonly found on the farms are: Caturra, Colombia, Castillo, Tipica, Red Bourbon, Pink Bourbon, and Tabi.
Harvest starts in October and peak harvest is in November;mitaca("fly crop") is May and peak mitaca is in June. Producers harvest and mill their coffee following quality standards: They do a selective hand picking of ripe cherry, ferment the coffee to adequate level, and dry the coffee between 1011.5% moisture content. The common practice is that the producers mill the coffee at their own farm, and once coffee is dried to the desire moisture content, it's transferred to Aromas del Sur's warehouse.
Aromas del Sur has a project called Universidad del Caf (coffee university), the focus of which is to teach and implement quality procedures among the group's producers. The goal of the project is to train the producers in agricultural practices, commercial know-how, and cupping ability.
Aromas del Sur's warehouse functions as a storage place for parchment coffee, and has a well-equipped cupping lab for quality control. Each lot is cupped get the coffee profile and to check the quality.
Palestina, located in the south of Huila, is also know as Agua Azul, ("blue water") because it's considered the main source of water for the department of Huila, having several water sources such as: Guarapas River, Suaza River, Aguas Claras River, La Quebradona River, Agua Azul River, and La Cumbre River.

THIS COFFEE WAS SOURCED BY CAFE IMPORTS
This process is known as E.A. Sugarcane. It starts by fermenting molasses to create ethanol and combining it with acetic acidfound in vinegarto make ethyl acetate. This is added to water, and applied to the green coffee to dissolve the caffeine completely out of the beans. The caffeine is separated from the greens and is steamed and washed with more water.
This is truly an exceptional cup of coffee with flavors of citrus, caramel, and honey.

THIS COFFEE WAS SOURCED WITH CAFE IMPORTS
Ecuador has great potential and is one of my favorite origins for being exotic but also having the quality to back it up; the big issue we see at the moment is volume. The country as a whole only exports 100 containers/year (40,000 lbs/container) of Washed Arabica. Caf Imports alone moves more than 100 containers/year. The rest of the coffee Ecuador produces is low quality Naturals and Robusta to sustain its huge instant coffee market for internal consumption and exports. To put this into perspective:
Origin Country / Containers per Year (estimate)
The producers in this area still have traditional varieties such as Typica, Caturra, and Bourbon, which has been key to their success. Rust has been an issue for most of these producers and having organic certification limits the products you can apply to your farm making it tougher.
The microclimate in this area is very particular. It is very wet almost year-round and has good temperature fluctuations from 12 - 28 degrees Celsius with an average of 20 degrees. This weather is ideal for coffee growing and it reflects in the cup.
The South of Ecuador has smallholders with 1.5 hectares on average. While in the North we see larger farms.
Typical Southern farms will be organic and extremely diverse with flowers, corn, cabbages, bananas, bees, cows, fish, fruits, and coffee. A big challenge these farmers are facing at the moment is leaf rust. This decimated plantations in Colombia bringing their production down 50% in a couple of years. The easiest solution for leaf-rust is intensive chemical applications but their respect for the environment makes them take the harder organic route. Also, plant nutrition in Ecuador is extremely low due to little fertilization. This affects cup quality and yields from parchment to green coffee.
Farms in the North are bigger, at 15 hectares or more. They use conventional fertilizers and are in better shape in general; the area is extremely lush and in very moist conditions with a nice warm summer creating good conditions for growing coffee. This area is extremely interesting, you will find: ancient indigenous tombs, a vineyard, and an experimental variety farm ran by NESPRESSO.

Our favorite friend from Sulawesi is back and better than ever. This coffee is like a lemon bar covered in toffee.
Region: Pango Pango, TorajaFarm: VariousVarietal:S795Altitude: 1400-1600 MASLProcessing Method:Fully Washed and Sundried
Sulawesi (formerly Celebes), was influenced and controlled by the Netherlands from 1605 until World War II. In 1669, the Dutch East India Company took control of the trade in Sulawesi. The Dutch built Fort Rotterdam in Ujung Pandang (now Makassar) in the mid 1600s, and gained full control of the island in 1905, making it part of the Dutch state colony of the Netherlands East Indies. The Dutch East India Company was in control of coffee production in Indonesia during most the 1700s and introduced Arabica Coffee (Typica) to Sulawesi in 1750.
It took some time for our buyers to arrive in Tana Toraja, Sulawesi, from Minneapolis, having to travel from Minneapolis to Tokyo, then Singapore, a stop in Jakarta, then land in Makassar and drive eight hours north to Rantepao, Tana Toraja. It is the most beautiful place on earth: green, lush, and rice paddies everywhere, giving it a sense of calmness. Traditional Tongkonan houses cover the background with fascinating Toraja Patterns decorating the structures.
Indonesian coffee has traditionally been processed with thegiling-basahmethod, or wet-hulled, like in Sumatra. In 1976 TOARCO, a Japanese-Indonesian joint-venture, introduced to Sulawesi the traditional washed-process, similar to that of Central America.
TOARCO ownsPedamaran Plantationat 9001250 meters, and purchases wet-parchment (at 40% moisture) from small producers at 12001800 meters. Coffee is trucked to Pedamaran Plantation immediately after purchase, and coffee gets dried on mechanical Yamamoto vertical dryers. Mr Watanabe, a TOARCO and Key Coffee veteran, had his origin training in Colombia with the FNC and has always respected their approach to coffee production. TOARCO is now testing out Colombian Penagos horizontal dryers or guardiolas.
If a producer wants to sell their parchment coffee to TOARCO, they need to get certified to the quality standards as far as selective picking, storage, transportation, moisture levels, etc. Farmers are issued ID cards that allow them to sell their coffee at various purchasing points in the Tana Toraja region during the market week. Caf Imports coffee comes from small producers at the higher altitude areas.
Most of the coffee produced in Toraja is S795 variety, developed in India to be resistant to leaf rust. The genetics of this variety is Typica and Liberica; even though it has Liberica (Robusta-esque species) genes we've seen 88+ and 90+ cups in these coffees.
The V60 is another brewing device that has our hearts.
Hario V60 - 02 Ceramic Coffee Dripper is ceramic cone-style filter with vortex radial drain pattern and an open end, allowing coffee to drop/drip as it needs providing a greater depth and character during extraction.

THIS COFFEE WAS SOURCED WITH CAFE IMPORTS
Ecuador has great potential and is one of my favorite origins for being exotic but also having the quality to back it up; the big issue we see at the moment is volume. The country as a whole only exports 100 containers/year (40,000 lbs/container) of Washed Arabica. Caf Imports alone moves more than 100 containers/year. The rest of the coffee Ecuador produces is low quality Naturals and Robusta to sustain its huge instant coffee market for internal consumption and exports. To put this into perspective:
Origin Country / Containers per Year (estimate)
The producers in this area still have traditional varieties such as Typica, Caturra, and Bourbon, which has been key to their success. Rust has been an issue for most of these producers and having organic certification limits the products you can apply to your farm making it tougher.
The microclimate in this area is very particular. It is very wet almost year-round and has good temperature fluctuations from 12 - 28 degrees Celsius with an average of 20 degrees. This weather is ideal for coffee growing and it reflects in the cup.
The South of Ecuador has smallholders with 1.5 hectares on average. While in the North we see larger farms.
Typical Southern farms will be organic and extremely diverse with flowers, corn, cabbages, bananas, bees, cows, fish, fruits, and coffee. A big challenge these farmers are facing at the moment is leaf rust. This decimated plantations in Colombia bringing their production down 50% in a couple of years. The easiest solution for leaf-rust is intensive chemical applications but their respect for the environment makes them take the harder organic route. Also, plant nutrition in Ecuador is extremely low due to little fertilization. This affects cup quality and yields from parchment to green coffee.
Farms in the North are bigger, at 15 hectares or more. They use conventional fertilizers and are in better shape in general; the area is extremely lush and in very moist conditions with a nice warm summer creating good conditions for growing coffee. This area is extremely interesting, you will find: ancient indigenous tombs, a vineyard, and an experimental variety farm ran by NESPRESSO.

Our favorite friend from Sulawesi is back and better than ever. This coffee is like a lemon bar covered in toffee.
Region: Pango Pango, TorajaFarm: VariousVarietal:S795Altitude: 1400-1600 MASLProcessing Method:Fully Washed and Sundried
Sulawesi (formerly Celebes), was influenced and controlled by the Netherlands from 1605 until World War II. In 1669, the Dutch East India Company took control of the trade in Sulawesi. The Dutch built Fort Rotterdam in Ujung Pandang (now Makassar) in the mid 1600s, and gained full control of the island in 1905, making it part of the Dutch state colony of the Netherlands East Indies. The Dutch East India Company was in control of coffee production in Indonesia during most the 1700s and introduced Arabica Coffee (Typica) to Sulawesi in 1750.
It took some time for our buyers to arrive in Tana Toraja, Sulawesi, from Minneapolis, having to travel from Minneapolis to Tokyo, then Singapore, a stop in Jakarta, then land in Makassar and drive eight hours north to Rantepao, Tana Toraja. It is the most beautiful place on earth: green, lush, and rice paddies everywhere, giving it a sense of calmness. Traditional Tongkonan houses cover the background with fascinating Toraja Patterns decorating the structures.
Indonesian coffee has traditionally been processed with thegiling-basahmethod, or wet-hulled, like in Sumatra. In 1976 TOARCO, a Japanese-Indonesian joint-venture, introduced to Sulawesi the traditional washed-process, similar to that of Central America.
TOARCO ownsPedamaran Plantationat 9001250 meters, and purchases wet-parchment (at 40% moisture) from small producers at 12001800 meters. Coffee is trucked to Pedamaran Plantation immediately after purchase, and coffee gets dried on mechanical Yamamoto vertical dryers. Mr Watanabe, a TOARCO and Key Coffee veteran, had his origin training in Colombia with the FNC and has always respected their approach to coffee production. TOARCO is now testing out Colombian Penagos horizontal dryers or guardiolas.
If a producer wants to sell their parchment coffee to TOARCO, they need to get certified to the quality standards as far as selective picking, storage, transportation, moisture levels, etc. Farmers are issued ID cards that allow them to sell their coffee at various purchasing points in the Tana Toraja region during the market week. Caf Imports coffee comes from small producers at the higher altitude areas.
Most of the coffee produced in Toraja is S795 variety, developed in India to be resistant to leaf rust. The genetics of this variety is Typica and Liberica; even though it has Liberica (Robusta-esque species) genes we've seen 88+ and 90+ cups in these coffees.

We are happy to introduce to you a new group called: "Aromas del Sur located in Palestina, Huila. We are working together with Aromas del Sur to bring to you the best coffees from Palestina.
The founding members created the group in 2013, when they discovered the potential of specialty coffee production. Currently 73 active members compromise Aromas del Sur.
The average farm size is 6 hectares with an altitude range going from 1400 to 1900 masl. The highest farm is located at 1970 masl. The varieties commonly found on the farms are: Caturra, Colombia, Castillo, Tipica, Red Bourbon, Pink Bourbon, and Tabi.
Harvest starts in October and peak harvest is in November;mitaca("fly crop") is May and peak mitaca is in June. Producers harvest and mill their coffee following quality standards: They do a selective hand picking of ripe cherry, ferment the coffee to adequate level, and dry the coffee between 1011.5% moisture content. The common practice is that the producers mill the coffee at their own farm, and once coffee is dried to the desire moisture content, it's transferred to Aromas del Sur's warehouse.
Aromas del Sur has a project called Universidad del Caf (coffee university), the focus of which is to teach and implement quality procedures among the group's producers. The goal of the project is to train the producers in agricultural practices, commercial know-how, and cupping ability.
Aromas del Sur's warehouse functions as a storage place for parchment coffee, and has a well-equipped cupping lab for quality control. Each lot is cupped get the coffee profile and to check the quality.
Palestina, located in the south of Huila, is also know as Agua Azul, ("blue water") because it's considered the main source of water for the department of Huila, having several water sources such as: Guarapas River, Suaza River, Aguas Claras River, La Quebradona River, Agua Azul River, and La Cumbre River.

This process is known as E.A. Sugarcane. It starts by fermenting molasses to create ethanol and combining it with acetic acidfound in vinegarto make ethyl acetate. This is added to water, and applied to the green coffee to dissolve the caffeine completely out of the beans. The caffeine is separated from the greens and is steamed and washed with more water.
This is truly an exceptional cup of coffee with flavors of citrus, caramel, and honey.

THIS COFFEE WAS SOURCED WITH CAFE IMPORTS
Ecuador has great potential and is one of my favorite origins for being exotic but also having the quality to back it up; the big issue we see at the moment is volume. The country as a whole only exports 100 containers/year (40,000 lbs/container) of Washed Arabica. Caf Imports alone moves more than 100 containers/year. The rest of the coffee Ecuador produces is low quality Naturals and Robusta to sustain its huge instant coffee market for internal consumption and exports. To put this into perspective:
Origin Country / Containers per Year (estimate)
The producers in this area still have traditional varieties such as Typica, Caturra, and Bourbon, which has been key to their success. Rust has been an issue for most of these producers and having organic certification limits the products you can apply to your farm making it tougher.
The microclimate in this area is very particular. It is very wet almost year-round and has good temperature fluctuations from 12 - 28 degrees Celsius with an average of 20 degrees. This weather is ideal for coffee growing and it reflects in the cup.
The South of Ecuador has smallholders with 1.5 hectares on average. While in the North we see larger farms.
Typical Southern farms will be organic and extremely diverse with flowers, corn, cabbages, bananas, bees, cows, fish, fruits, and coffee. A big challenge these farmers are facing at the moment is leaf rust. This decimated plantations in Colombia bringing their production down 50% in a couple of years. The easiest solution for leaf-rust is intensive chemical applications but their respect for the environment makes them take the harder organic route. Also, plant nutrition in Ecuador is extremely low due to little fertilization. This affects cup quality and yields from parchment to green coffee.
Farms in the North are bigger, at 15 hectares or more. They use conventional fertilizers and are in better shape in general; the area is extremely lush and in very moist conditions with a nice warm summer creating good conditions for growing coffee. This area is extremely interesting, you will find: ancient indigenous tombs, a vineyard, and an experimental variety farm ran by NESPRESSO.

Our favorite friend from Sulawesi is back and better than ever. This coffee is like a lemon bar covered in toffee.
Region: Pango Pango, TorajaFarm: VariousVarietal:S795Altitude: 1400-1600 MASLProcessing Method:Fully Washed and Sundried
Sulawesi (formerly Celebes), was influenced and controlled by the Netherlands from 1605 until World War II. In 1669, the Dutch East India Company took control of the trade in Sulawesi. The Dutch built Fort Rotterdam in Ujung Pandang (now Makassar) in the mid 1600s, and gained full control of the island in 1905, making it part of the Dutch state colony of the Netherlands East Indies. The Dutch East India Company was in control of coffee production in Indonesia during most the 1700s and introduced Arabica Coffee (Typica) to Sulawesi in 1750.
It took some time for our buyers to arrive in Tana Toraja, Sulawesi, from Minneapolis, having to travel from Minneapolis to Tokyo, then Singapore, a stop in Jakarta, then land in Makassar and drive eight hours north to Rantepao, Tana Toraja. It is the most beautiful place on earth: green, lush, and rice paddies everywhere, giving it a sense of calmness. Traditional Tongkonan houses cover the background with fascinating Toraja Patterns decorating the structures.
Indonesian coffee has traditionally been processed with thegiling-basahmethod, or wet-hulled, like in Sumatra. In 1976 TOARCO, a Japanese-Indonesian joint-venture, introduced to Sulawesi the traditional washed-process, similar to that of Central America.
TOARCO ownsPedamaran Plantationat 9001250 meters, and purchases wet-parchment (at 40% moisture) from small producers at 12001800 meters. Coffee is trucked to Pedamaran Plantation immediately after purchase, and coffee gets dried on mechanical Yamamoto vertical dryers. Mr Watanabe, a TOARCO and Key Coffee veteran, had his origin training in Colombia with the FNC and has always respected their approach to coffee production. TOARCO is now testing out Colombian Penagos horizontal dryers or guardiolas.
If a producer wants to sell their parchment coffee to TOARCO, they need to get certified to the quality standards as far as selective picking, storage, transportation, moisture levels, etc. Farmers are issued ID cards that allow them to sell their coffee at various purchasing points in the Tana Toraja region during the market week. Caf Imports coffee comes from small producers at the higher altitude areas.
Most of the coffee produced in Toraja is S795 variety, developed in India to be resistant to leaf rust. The genetics of this variety is Typica and Liberica; even though it has Liberica (Robusta-esque species) genes we've seen 88+ and 90+ cups in these coffees.

We are happy to introduce to you a new group called: "Aromas del Sur located in Palestina, Huila. We are working together with Aromas del Sur to bring to you the best coffees from Palestina.

Harvest starts in October and peak harvest is in November;mitaca("fly crop") is May and peak mitaca is in June. Producers harvest and mill their coffee following quality standards: They do a selective hand picking of ripe cherry, ferment the coffee to adequate level, and dry the coffee between 1011.5% moisture content. The common practice is that the producers mill the coffee at their own farm, and once coffee is dried to the desire moisture content, it's transferred to Aromas del Sur's warehouse.
Aromas del Sur has a project called Universidad del Caf (coffee university), the focus of which is to teach and implement quality procedures among the group's producers. The goal of the project is to train the producers in agricultural practices, commercial know-how, and cupping ability.

Most of the coffee produced in Toraja is S795 variety, developed in India to be resistant to leaf rust. The genetics of this variety is Typica and Liberica; even though it has Liberica (Robusta-esque species) genes we've seen 88+ and 90+ cups in these coffees.

Region: Los Pinos, Palestina, HuilaFarm: La PedregosaVarietal:CaturraAltitude: 1780 MASLProcessing Method:Fully Washed and Sundried
We are happy to introduce to you a new group called: "Aromas del Sur located in Palestina, Huila. We are working together with Aromas del Sur to bring to you the best coffees from Palestina.
The founding members created the group in 2013, when they discovered the potential of specialty coffee production. Currently 73 active members compromise Aromas del Sur.
The average farm size is 6 hectares with an altitude range going from 1400 to 1900 masl. The highest farm is located at 1970 masl. The varieties commonly found on the farms are: Caturra, Colombia, Castillo, Tipica, Red Bourbon, Pink Bourbon, and Tabi.
Harvest starts in October and peak harvest is in November;mitaca("fly crop") is May and peak mitaca is in June. Producers harvest and mill their coffee following quality standards: They do a selective hand picking of ripe cherry, ferment the coffee to adequate level, and dry the coffee between 1011.5% moisture content. The common practice is that the producers mill the coffee at their own farm, and once coffee is dried to the desire moisture content, it's transferred to Aromas del Sur's warehouse.
Aromas del Sur has a project called Universidad del Caf (coffee university), the focus of which is to teach and implement quality procedures among the group's producers. The goal of the project is to train the producers in agricultural practices, commercial know-how, and cupping ability.
Aromas del Sur's warehouse functions as a storage place for parchment coffee, and has a well-equipped cupping lab for quality control. Each lot is cupped get the coffee profile and to check the quality.
Palestina, located in the south of Huila, is also know as Agua Azul, ("blue water") because it's considered the main source of water for the department of Huila, having several water sources such as: Guarapas River, Suaza River, Aguas Claras River, La Quebradona River, Agua Azul River, and La Cumbre River.

THIS COFFEE WAS SOURCED BY CAFE IMPORTS
This process is known as E.A. Sugarcane. It starts by fermenting molasses to create ethanol and combining it with acetic acidfound in vinegarto make ethyl acetate. This is added to water, and applied to the green coffee to dissolve the caffeine completely out of the beans. The caffeine is separated from the greens and is steamed and washed with more water.
This is truly an exceptional cup of coffee with flavors of citrus, caramel, and honey.
We developed this blend to please all palettes. It is comprised of 50% Kenya and 50% Colombia.
Our hope with this coffee is that it can be shared amongst family and friends without worry.

Otilio Leiva returns to us for the second year in a row. Through five tables of offering in our sourcing trip last year, Otilio stood out as a top selection. We were later surprised to learn that it was the first year Beneficio San Vicente isoalted his harvest to produce a single producer lot based on his improving quality. San Vicente is an exceptional, quality driven mill run by the Paz family. The micro-lot program is handled by Benjamin, who maintians clear communication between producers and roasters, while the qulaity controll operations are maintained by his cousin Arturo. Each memeber of the Paz family are themselves among the top producers of Honduras who share their experience and knowledge with the many producers in their network. The Los Andes region is incredibly slick and steep; often requiring mules to carry the daily harvests down the single-track trail. In his first year producing a micro-lot Otilio only produced 3 exportable bags, however this year he was able increase his output to 10. We are honored to be once again offering Otilio Leivas crop and be a part of his growth as we see his coffee improve.
Otilio Leiva starts off tasting of fresh peach and buttery pie crust, developing into notes of blackberries stewed in white wine. There is a long lingering finsh of fresh herbs such as mint, thyme, and sage. This coffee carries the rich stonefruit tones we first fell in love with, but shows the clarity of another year of farm improvements. It is the perfect coffee to sip as you celebrate the relationships in your life this time of year.
Jos Amado Fernndez is a historically exceptional producer. He placed first in the 2010 Honduran Cup of Excellence, and sixth in 2013. Don Amado, the farms namesake and Joss father, passed this farm down to his four sons. Each son inherited his own lot, but share a central facility for washing and processing. The brothers individually oversee their own parcel and process their coffee separately. Jos Amado Fernndezs parcel is 4.2 hectares and directly overlooks Lake Yojoa, the largest in Honduras. Our relationship with Jos began with us visiting his farm during the harvest of 2014. He had one of the cleanest and most organized farms we have ever seen. That attention to detail on a farm level carries throughout his production resulting in a beautiful cup. We have been able to commit to purchasing Joss second harvest each year and are proud to bring this back in for the second time. The peach notes and richness carries over from last year, but we are seeing significantly more complexity and improvement in the cup quality overall. Don Amado initially tastes like spiced chocolate and dark nuts, but as it cools the sweetness moves more forward, creating a much more complex cup. The interaction between the spiced nut tones and light carameliness remind us of traditional pecan pie; finishing with a rich stonefruit note similar to peach infused sweet tea. This coffee is dense, complex, and fitting for the season. It is the perfect coffee for these cooler fall mornings.
The Aguilera Brothers manage six farms and their own micro-mill operation entirely within the family, with the exception of a few pickers during the harvest season. The 12 brothers and sisters inherited the farms from their parents and are now incorporating the third generation into the family business. Each of their farms is planted almost exclusively with Villa Sarchi, a mutation of Bourbon native to the region. This dwarf varietal is known for high production yields and often carries exceptionally floral cupping notes and elegant, tropical fruit acidities. Many Villa Sarchi coffees can be unbalanced in their intensity, but each coffee we have tasted from the Aguilera Brothers has been far more refined than any other from this region. Last year we were able to begin our relationship with the Aguilera Brothers when Tony  our green buyer  visited the farms to meet the family and bought a honey processed lot from Finca Angelina. This year we are honored to serve this washed selection from Finca Chayote, located 200 meters higher in elevation on their most picturesque property. Finca Chayote starts off pear-like with soft herbal notes that develop into honeyed floral lemon tones very similar to an elderflower cordial. This coffee also has an intriguing mouthfeel that starts off very silky and syrupy but turns effervescent with a sweet, lingering finish. It is the perfect coffee for sipping while sitting on a dock, overlooking a calm lake.
Don Ignacio Gutierrez has been El Salvadors Cup of Excellence Champion in 2011, 2013, and 2015. The family transitioned to coffee production in 2005 after a long history of growing wood trees and tomatoes. Their first two farms, Los Positos and La Roxanita, consisted of just 500 trees. Their lands sandy loam soil and skilled farming practice lead them to great success in a short amount of time. Each years COE winnings were invested back into their farms, allowing them to continually improve harvests. Winning a single COE is an impressive achievement in its own right; to win three within five years is an exceptional feat. The lot that began the Gutierrez familys legacy was the 2011 harvest of this microlot, Finca La Roxanitas honey processed pacamara. The region of Chalatenango has built a solid reputation for amazing honey processed pacamaras and this farm is one that laid that foundation.
Ignacio Gutierrezs honey pacamara from Finca La Roxanita starts bright and fruity with notes of ripe blackberry and allspice. As it develops on the palate there are complex tones of grilled pineapple, vanilla, and lime with a slight resinous nature that together reminds us of a bright California chardonnay aged on new oak. This coffee is dynamic and complex, but is in no way off-putting. It is the perfect coffee to showcase the mastery Ignacio applies to coffee production, allowing him to be one of the most consistent and outstanding producers in coffee today.
RespectYou go through life meeting a million people, especially in the hospitality industry, and even more so after founding Spyhouse 15 years ago. You rarely meet someone that you immediately can connect with, both on a personal level, but also on a professional one. When you do meet that person, it is a connection that will hopefully be lifelong. I felt this during Laila's visit to Spyhouse.
Meet Laila Ghambari, @lay_luh, Director of Coffee at Cherry Street Coffee in Seattle, who spent the last week in May with us. Her confident stature, bar prowess, and an operational understanding of precision and clarity were what inspired me to reach out to her. She is not only one to look up to in the coffee industry, but one to look up to in any industry. She is not only one to look up to as one of the leading women in coffee, but one of the leading persons in coffee. Laila is a testament to a strong work ethic while performing professionally with devotion, passion, and unwavering attention to detail. Thank you, Laila, for all your inspiration and insight. See you soon! - Christian, Founder/Owner Spyhouse Coffee Roasters
Ive been with Spyhouse for just over two years. I started as a barista at the Hennepin location, and got to watch with envy as Tony crafted a spectacular in-house roasting program for a company that was previously a multi-roaster shop. My love for coffee and restless desire for knowledge craved nothing more than to work directly with Tony, and learn and apprentice under him.
In January of 2014, that wish was granted when I was made a roasting and packaging assistant. Five short months later, I was full time in the roasting department acting as a production roaster and packaging manager. I was honored to have been lifted to that position in such a short time.
I never thought that within that brief period Id be given an opportunity to travel to origin. For that, Im incredibly grateful.
This trip, hosted by Caf Imports, brought Christian (owner) and I to the city of Xalapa in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. We and several others from roasting companies across the US were to judge a national coffee competition that Caf Imports has been organizing over the last few years to help bring prestige to the hard working coffee producers in Mexico who are often overlooked by the specialty coffee industry. Its called Lo Mejor De Mexico  literally, The Best of Mexico.
Lo Mejor De Mexico has special significance to us at Spyhouse. Last year, two of our employees Kathie, our educator; and Kimberly, a barista competed in the Big Central regional Barista Championship with a coffee from Ixhautln, Mexico, that won 3rd place in last years Lo Mejor competition. Those who are regulars might remember it for its killer espresso profile and elegantly balanced brew character. It was truly a coffee that could bring a smile to anyone, and we like to think it helped changed some preconceived notions of Mexican coffee.
This years competition took place over two days in the Beneficio Las Animas wet mill. Entries from all over Mexico were submitted, and Caf Imports team narrowed around 50 submissions down to half that for the scored and judged rounds. The first day consisted of 3 rounds of cupping, each judge filling out score sheets based around dry fragrance, wet aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, sweetness, and an overall cuppers score.
Between each around, every cupper shared his or her scores and thoughts for each coffee. Soon, a top 10 emerged.
The next day, the 10 advancing coffees were re-roasted and re-cupped. There was a palpable tension in the air amongst the echoing slurps as each cupper focused intently on grading and evaluating every coffee they tasted. After all, we were deciding the best coffee in Mexico a heavy decision.
Results were tabulated, information was disbursed, and an award ceremony was held later that night. This year brought about a first for the Lo Mejor competition: a live auction of the top 10 winning coffees. Producers who placed in the top 10 were invited to the ceremony to receive congratulations and awards from AMSA, another organizer of Lo Mejor and a company dedicated to enriching and enhancing coffee farming in Mexico.
Intense bidding ensued, and the farmers who produced such spectacular coffees were rewarded with a price per pound well above average market value (as well as the aforementioned prizes from AMSA). When the dust finally settled, each and every representative of the present US roasteries had a huge grin on their face and an appetite that could only be satiated by tacos and tequila both of which were aplenty after the auction.
We at Spyhouse won 28 bags total in the auction, each bag being 69kg/~150lbs: 5 of the 27 total bags of the 1st Place coffee, GRAPOS El Porvenir; and the entire 23 bag lot of El Amate, the 5th Place coffee (though both Christian and I scored El Amate as our 3rd favorite coffee overall).
Between rounds of cupping, we spent much of our time traveling to other significant coffee-related sites around the area. The Dos Rios dry mill we visited is responsible for the sorting and final preparation of coffee received from various wet mills around the region. Additionally, Dos Rios has a large coffee nursery where scientists are working on creating genetic hybrids of Robusta plants and specialty-grade Arabica plants in an effort to fight the roya (rust) leaf disease that has been devastating many Central and South American coffee farms. Robusta plants are incredibly disease resistant and high producing, and this hybridization process (known as embryogenesis) is able to create a coffee plant with the exceptional heartiness Robusta is known for while retaining the complex and delicious cup character of Arabica.
We also visited the farms of two producers who entered the Lo Mejor competition. Finca Consopalan and Finca Fatima are both a short drive from Xalapa in the region of Coatepec. Though Mexicos harvest season is over, there were still many flowering and fruited plants on the farms. The beauty of both farms was immeasurable, and the care and dedication of their respective producers both of whom we met was instantly noticeable.
Our first and foremost mission at Spyhouse is to responsibly source amazing coffees and build direct relationships with excellent producers. Our commitment to this shows in the coffees we buy out of major growing regions like Costa Rica, Colombia, Guatemala, Ethiopia, etc. Additionally, we strongly believe in developing and encouraging excellent coffee in passed-over regions like Peru, Ecuador, and Mexico. Since the inception of our roasting program, weve made it a point to work closely with producers in these areas to help maximize their potential and bring you, the customer, the best coffee possible.
We hope you enjoy drinking these coffees as much as we enjoyed sourcing and buying them for you. Look for them in our offerings list in the next few months.

Division was designed to exhibit the fervor of mulitple elements in alliance, creating a rich & complex profile of dark sugars. We crafted this offering on the foundation of rich chocolate and caramel notes with just enough sweet, dark fruit overtones to make it an exceptionally versatile coffee. Primarily intended to serve as a brewed offering, this coffee has been shaped to serve as an alternative to Orion, our flagship espresso.
Division was created to be paired with food. The rich body holds up well against heavier traditional breakfast items. Inversely the fruit tones are held in careful balance to compliment a wide range of pastries and desserts. Although sweetness is clearly present in the cup, it is not overpowering. We created this offering to showcase the versatility of a carefully balanced cup. This makes Division an exceptional choice for cafes and restaurants looking for a work horse coffee. We like to think of this offering as the nicest diner coffee you will ever find; perfect for bookending your day.
Although the elements shift occasionally to reflect the seasonality of coffee harvests, we are careful in our selection of what we pair in Division. While looking for rich, sugared tones we make sure we are working with reputable cooperatives, known for consistent quality and fair practices.

San Isidro de Leon Cortes, Tarrazu
Don Cesar Urena produces some of the most amazingly clean, sweet, and complex honey processed and cherry-dried coffees we have ever seen at his micro-mill named after his father, Don Pepe. San Isidro de Leon Cortez overlooks the Tarrazu river, creating a beautifully stable microclimate with ample natural water sources. Cesar uses this unique climate to his advantage by leaving his fruit and parchment spread out and uncovered, allowing the cooler evening air to slow down the fermentation process. His processing takes two to three times longer than normal, but the clarity he achieves by waiting is unmatched in the cup. On top of producing exceptional coffee, Cesar is simply an amazing person. Riding to his mill we learned his relationship with Cafe Imports began when Cesar stopped to fix Pieros, their green buyer, flat tire. Last year we had exclusive US access to his cherry-dried lot. Earlier this year we featuredthe cherry-dried lot from Finca El Bananal, and proudly now offer that farms honey processed lot; Cesar highest scoring from this years harvest.
Don Pepes Finca El Bananal, Honey Micro-Lot starts of with a rich honeycomb sweetness and citrus zest overtones, reminiscent of marmalade. The cup finishes very sweet and clear, with a slight spiciness, like pear cider. This coffee showcases the power of the right varietals, grown in the right places, being processed in the right way to highlight their influence. It is the perfect coffee to share with that sweet lil thang snuggled up to you.

El Barranco is produced by Francisco Florencio Mendez high in the mountains of San Pedro Necta, Huehuetenango, near the Mexico border. He operates his farm with the help of his brother and father, whom both have neighboring farms and share a central wet mill.
Our relationship with Francisco began when Christian, our owner/founder, and another staff member stopped for a bottle of Coke on the side of the road, right at the entrance to the familys multiple farms. The Mendezs pridefully toured them through their farms, displaying their great passion and drive to produce exceptional coffee. Later that same day, while blind cupping 30 coffees from various farms in the region, both Christian and Katies two favorite selections were produced by Francisco. It is an honor to be working with this family and have their coffee returning for a second year.
El Barranco begins with flavors of chocolate, caramel, nuts and vanilla that together remind us of aturtle sundays. As the flavors develop on your pallet, the acidity opens up into notes of fresh orange zest, supported by a boozy cherry note similar to a rye Manhattan. This coffee is a refined example of why so many people fall in love with this region. It is the perfect coffee to sip along side sweeter breakfast items or to pair with a wide range of desserts.

La Candelilla was founded by Victor Mora, one of the first to settle in the Tarraz Valley, and has been growing Arabica since the early 1900s. In the 1940s Rafael Snchez and his wife Luca, Victors daughter, took over the opperation of the farm and has run it for five generations. To take greater controll of their product the family established their own micromill in 2000 as one of the first in the region and has been producing specialty grade coffee since. The Tarraz Valley is possibly the most famous coffee region in Costa Rica, but is facing an uncertain future as farms are quickly being converted to real estate.
Gesha, the most sought after coffee varietal, was originally planted in the 1950s for its disease resistant propretites. The varietal originated in the Ethiopian town of Gesha, but the Peterson family farm, Hacienda Esmerelda in Panama, created the fame we know today. This exceptionally beautiful varietal produces some of the most delicate and fragant coffee, unlike any other in the world. However, to match its delicate profile, the plant is very sensitive and will only grow well in perfect conditions with great care. Farms charge exceptionally high prices for a properly produced Gesha because it is simply incomparable.
This offering carries notes of vanilla blossom and fresh strawberry jam. Their is a malty tea undertone and light body that reminds us of caramel assam.
This coffee will be roasted next on Monday, Dec. 14th. All orders placed will ship at that time.

Chocolate Panettone / Cherry / Aged Rum
Luis Hernando Morales Arias was born in Bogata, Colombia but moved with his mother to Gaitania at 11 to collect her paternal inheritence. Growing up in the country, he was immersed in the coffee growing culture and spent his life advancing his coffee cultivation knowledge. Luis has seen his participation in the Cup of Excellence as a way for him to continue his education. This dedication to improving his skill has deffinitely paid off as this lot, La Esmerelda, placed 11th in the Colombian national competition. La Esmerelda is run by Luis, his wife, and their two children.
The Cup of Excellence was created by the Alliance for Coffee Excellence to find and reward the highest quality coffee producers in each country that it operates. International judges volunteer to blindly taste and score submissions, and through multiple rounds select the top twenty coffees. The winners are then placed in an auction for buyers to bid on their desired lots. The premiums a high-placing winner can receive are often life changing.
Luis Morales starts off with a rich, juicy cherry and chocolate note and carries a heavy lingering finish like a well-aged rum. As it cools, more floral, citric, and spiced notes come forward. This coffee is incredibly complex, yet very approachable and fitting for the season. It is the perfect coffee for enjoying with family this Holiday season.

The Ndiaini wet mill is opperated by 901 individual, local members as part of the Rumukia Farmers Cooperative Society Limited in the Karatina area of Nyeri. Together they manage a total of 312 acres. Ndiaini is the third largest cooperative of the eight in the society, but has a higher number of total female members than any of the groups. The mill is located directly five miles west, along the Othaya Karatina highway, from the center of Othaya town, where we have found all of our favorite Kenyan offerings. This area has rich, red volcanic soil - full of phosphorous. Mixing that soil with high elevation, great drainage, and strong varietals, the group is able to harvest coffee that has matured slowly, developing dense beans full of rich flavors. That complexity is highlighted in this offering being from the mills peaberry sepearation - a naturally occuring varient bean that devlops just one mature seed per cherry, increasing the density of each bean.
Ndiaini is full of spice and complex sweetneess; the first impression is like biting into a ripe green apple devloping into complex fruit tones of honeydew melon, stawberry, raspberry, tangerine, and guava. There is a foundation of drying brown spice notes, similar to gingersnap cookies that support the fruit sweetness. The finish is sweet with a lingering heaviness that reminds us of honeywine. This coffee showcases the broad dyanimc range and complexity of coffees from this region without being offputting to most consumers. It is the perfect coffee to drink while you tackle that holiday baking.

A blend of chocolate tones and sweet fruits
Orion was designed to produce a unique espresso blend accentuating the elegance of chocolate and the complex nature of sweet fruit.
When we started planning our coffee program, we knew we wanted a strong, foundational house espresso; something complex enough to be enjoyed alone, and additionally have enough depth to hold up in milk. The combination of elements had to reflect something greater than their parts. Each character had to play its role to balance and accentuate the others. In unison, they create Orion: rich and silky in body, covering a range of chocolate tones with balancing notes of dark berries and citrus highlights. Although the elements occasionally change to reflect the seasonality of coffee harvests, these are the driving principles behind how we shape Orion.
Orion, our flagship espresso, bears a name loaded in history.Orion is a constellation on the celestial equator. It is so bright and recognizable in the sky that humans have been marveling at it since the beginning of time. The belt of Orion is aligned with major, unexplained monoliths, such as the Great Pyramids and Teotihuacan. In Mayan culture, Orion was believed to be the beginning point of all creation, and they built their metropolis in response to it. In Greek myths, Orion is a superhuman giant often represented with a bronze club and shield. Even some US history has references to Orion: The Hopi villages (in what is now Arizona) from 1120AD mimic major stars of Orion like a map. Hopi beloved Orion was origin of their creator, Massaw. Ubiquitous in myth, Orion is the foundation for cities and culture.

Peach Pie, Mint Berry Jam, Pinot Blanc
Otilio Leiva returns to us for the second year in a row. Through five tables of offering in our sourcing trip last year, Otilio stood out as a top selection. We were later surprised to learn that it was the first year Beneficio San Vicente isoalted his harvest to produce a single producer lot based on his improving quality. San Vicente is an exceptional, quality driven mill run by the Paz family. The micro-lot program is handled by Benjamin, who maintains clear communication between producers and roasters, while the quality controll operations are maintained by his cousin Arturo. Each memeber of the Paz family are themselves among the top producers of Honduras who share their experience and knowledge with the many producers in their network. The Los Andes region is incredibly slick and steep; often requiring mules to carry the daily harvests down the single-track trail. In his first year producing a micro-lot Otilio only produced 3 exportable bags, however this year he was able increase his output to 10. We are honored to be once again offering Otilio Leivas crop and be a part of his growth as we see his coffee improve.
Otilio Leiva starts off tasting of fresh peach and buttery pie crust, developing into notes of blackberries stewed in white wine. There is a long lingering finsh of fresh herbs such as mint, thyme, and sage. This coffee carries the rich stonefruit tones we first fell in love with, but shows the clarity of another year of farm improvements. It is the perfect coffee to sip as you celebrate the relationships in your life this time of year.

Division was designed to exhibit the fervor of mulitple elements in alliance, creating a rich & complex profile of dark sugars. We crafted this offering on the foundation of rich chocolate and caramel notes with just enough sweet, dark fruit overtones to make it an exceptionally versatile coffee. Primarily intended to serve as a brewed offering, this coffee has been shaped to serve as an alternative to Orion, our flagship espresso.
Division was created to be paired with food. The rich body holds up well against heavier traditional breakfast items. Inversely the fruit tones are held in careful balance to compliment a wide range of pastries and desserts. Although sweetness is clearly present in the cup, it is not overpowering. We created this offering to showcase the versatility of a carefully balanced cup. This makes Division an exceptional choice for cafes and restaurants looking for a work horse coffee. We like to think of this offering as the nicest diner coffee you will ever find; perfect for bookending your day.
Although the elements shift occasionally to reflect the seasonality of coffee harvests, we are careful in our selection of what we pair in Division. While looking for rich, sugared tones we make sure we are working with reputable cooperatives, known for consistent quality and fair practices.

Working directly with coffee producers, whether they are a farm, mill, or co-op is a major part of our mission here at Water Avenue Coffee (WAC). One of the best ways we can foster these relationships is by traveling to coffee producing countries to visit with our partners at origin. At the end of May, we traveled to Colombia to visit with one of our favorite coffee producing groups there, Caf Granja La Esperanza (GLE).
Caf Granja La Esperanza is an interesting group. Owned by the Herrera family of Cali, GLE owns five coffee farms themselves, while also helping with quality control and exporting for other co-ops. Over the past several years WAC has featured coffees from both GLEs farms as well as lots from other co-ops they work with, including the Colombia La Cristalina that is currently on our menu.
We started our trip flying from Portland, down to Cali, Colombia. Traveling were Emily, one of our Baristas, Kevin, owner of Christopher David Experience Design (serving Water Avenue Coffee in the Pearl District of Portland), and WACs Green Coffee Buyer and Roastery Manager, Aaron. After 22 hours of travel, we were met at the Cali airport by Rigoberto (Rigo) Herrera, President of GLE, and Estefania Salazar, GLEs Coffee Trader.
Cali sits in southern Colombia, on the upstream reaches of the Rio Cauca that anchors one of the countrys major regions, Valle de Cauca. This slow moving river winds its way across a broad flat plain running for over 900km, almost the entire length of Colombia. In the valley floor sugar cane dominates the landscape. Huge road trains made up of semi-trailers strung together move the harvested cane from the valley to the port of Buenaventura, and the air is hazy with smoke farmers burning their cane fields at harvest time
On either side of this valley the Andes rise in two massive cordilleras. On the West the Cordillera Occidental separates the valley from the Pacific Ocean in a series of mountains averaging 2000 meters in height. To the East the Cordillera Central separates the Cauca River from the massive Rio Magdalena, with ruggedly steep valleys and peaks reaching over 5300 meters.
Our first day in Colombia we drove north up the Valle de Cauca, to the town of Trujillo in the foothills of the Cordillera Occidental. Granja La Esperanza owns two farms just outside Trujillo, on the eastern slope of the mountains. Our first stop was the eponymous farm Granja La Esperanza, which is the location of the guesthouse and the wet mill for the two farms near Trujillo.
At Granja La Esperanza, GLE is in the process of renovating the farm by removing older coffee stock and establishing new plants. Just outside the back door of the guesthouse GLE has planted Laurina (Bourbon Pointu) type plants. These small, Christmas tree shaped plants produce coffee that is virtually caffeine free. Unlike most decaffeinated coffee that has to have the caffeine removed by the use of a solvent, Laurina naturally grows fruit and seeds that have only trace amounts of the stimulant. Unfortunately the Laurina plant is incredibly delicate, lacking much of the heartiness of its caffeinated cousins, and is often damaged while collecting its smaller than average harvest.
Uphill from the Laurina lot, GLE has begun the process of planting Sudan Rume type coffee shrubs. This rare type is often bred into disease resistant hybrids to improve the cup quality, but is rarely grown as its own variety. In the cup it rivals the famed Gesha type of coffees for flavor, but tends to be more consistent in the field, making it much easier for the coffee farmer to produce. The folks at GLE are betting big on this new heirloom type to compliment their already impressive array of high-end coffees.
Also new to the Granja is a lot of Colombia type coffee plants. This cultivar was developed by Cenicafe to be resistant to Roya, a fungus that has devastated coffee farms throughout the world. The project that came up with the Colombia variety was started decades ago, when Roya first began appearing in Latin America, and was officially released in 1982. It is often thought of as a less desirable cultivar because it incorporates some of the genetics of the Robusta plant, which can introduce bitterness to the cup and reduce the acidity. GLEs hope is that through careful husbandry and innovative natural processing techniques they can bring this to market as a delicious yet budget friendly offering.
Although Finca Cerro Azul is only a few miles away from Granja La Esperanza it provides a totally different experience. Cerro Azul sits at the crest of the cordillera, topping out at 1950 meters. This gives it access to the cool breezes coming off the Pacific Ocean to the west, as well as warm air rising off the floor of Valle de Cauca to the east. This combination is very similar to the Boquete region of Panama, where the Gesha type rose to fame, and GLE has planted Cerro Azul exclusively with this prized variety of Arabica.
GLE has won many awards with coffees produced on Cerro Azul, but they have also learned firsthand how difficult growing Gesha can be. Gesha was brought to Latin America from Ethiopia in the 1940s and retains many of the characteristics of the wild coffee plant it was less than a century ago. The same seedstock will produce several distinct types coffee plants, each with its own cup profile. Over the course of several years GLE has worked to further refine the Gesha type, isolating what they hope is a stable type with the ideal cup profile.
Across the valley from Trujillo and further to the north, the city of Caicedonia has long been a center of coffee production in Colombia. Caicedonia is home to GLEs warehouses as well as their QC lab and offices. Outside of the city GLE owns and operates two coffee farms, Potosi and Las Margaritas. Both these farms sit in the Cordillera Central of the Andes, markedly different terrain than Finca Cerro Azul and Granja La Esperanza in Cordillera Occidental. Outside Caicedonia the mountains nearly overlap each other, creating steep crisscrossing valleys that contrast to the more open vistas to the west. Fincas Potosi and Las Margaritas are nestled in the same deep T-shaped valley adjoining and facing each other.
Finca Potosi has been in the Herrera family since Rigos great grandparents settled it, and in many ways it represents the regions coffee growing heritage. Lots from this farm are the more common Caturra and Colombia varieties, not the more boutique and exotic types grown on their other farms. While lots from this farm are geared towards broader appeal and a more budget friendly price, GLE puts the same dedication to quality in these lots as it does the more expensive ones. Information is recorded at every step of the way, from the climatic conditions on the farm, to the fermentation temperature in the mill, and the cup profiles of specific plants, all in an effort to continually improve their product
Across the valley, Finca Las Margaritas is something of a botanical garden. GLE has planted different types of coffee plants throughout this farm, including Sudan Rume, Pacamara, Red Bourbon, Yellow Bourbon, Tekisic, Gesha, Mokka, and several new types Rigo wasnt ready to tell us about. Planting the farm with different varieties allows GLE to study the genetic influence of different types of coffee plants and their impact on the final cup.
In the Finca Las Margaritas valley sits the farms wet mill and drying station. Unlike many areas that grow coffee, Colombia doesnt have strongly defined wet and dry seasons, which can make drying coffee on outdoor patios challenging. Patios in Colombia all have roofs that roll out to cover the coffee as the weather changes. Being able to dry coffee evenly and quickly is essential to the quality of the cup, and to facilitate this GLE is investing in mechanical driers at their mills. This allows them to jump-start or even complete drying the coffee, reducing the opportunities for damage due to uneven drying.
Back at the lab in Caicedonia we tasted coffees from all of GLEs farms, as well as lots from other producer groups they work with. We were truly able to taste just how much work goes into producing the coffees we enjoy here. It was amazing to taste the impact that terroir can have on the cup, as we cupped lots of the same variety from several of their farms. The same Geshas from different parts of the same mountains (Granja La Esperanza, and Cerro Azul) tasted markedly different simply because they exist in slightly different microclimates. Comparing those to the Geshas grown at Finca Las Margaritas in a different range altogether was even more striking.
Although we only spent three days with Rigo, Estefania, and the GLE crew we were able to begin to appreciate why their coffees have the renown they do. Granja La Esperanza is constantly working on refining their growing and processing techniques, looking to expand on the successes of the past while experimenting and innovating to continuously raise the bar for quality. We are looking forward to featuring some of the coffees we tasted once they arrive here in the United States, and growing Water Avenue Coffees relationship with Granja La Esperanza in the years to come.

While Rwanda has grown coffee since the 1930s it is only over the last decade that producers there have participated in the specialty sector of the market. During the early 20th century the Belgian colonial government of Rwanda forced farmers there to plant coffee trees as an export crop, but only the lowest grades of commodity coffee were produced. After the tragedies that took place in the 1990s Rwanda was left with its economy in ruins, and looked to the coffee industry to help rebuild.
In many ways Rwanda provides an excellent environment for growing coffee: it has rich volcanic soil, high elevations, and ample rainfall. It soon became apparent that the reason Rwanda hadnt grown great coffee in the past wasnt due to the lack of the right conditions. Instead it was the result of a lack of education on how to properly care for the plants and the infrastructure to process it and bring it to market.
In the early 2000s the Rwandan government began to work in concert with international donors like USAID to formulate a plan to rebuild the countrys economy. The Rwandan Coffee Authority formulated a plan to increase both the quality and the volume of the countrys agricultural production with the help of international donors. Funds from the IMF and the World Bank were used alongside those of nation donors to build coffee washing stations, improve infrastructure, and provide technical training to farmers and coffee processors.
In many ways the turnaround in Rwandas coffee market is one of the great success stories of international development. Rwanda is at the same time one of the most agrarian and most densely populated countries in Africa, meaning that intense pressure is put on a small land base to support a large population. The vast majority of Rwandans support themselves by farming very small plots of land, and competition for land is fierce. It was this competition for scarce resources that was one of the main contributing factors to the instability of the 1990s.
Maximizing the return on the land available is essential to helping develop Rwanda, and to the countrys goal of moving away from an agriculture based economy. Growing better, higher value coffee increases the productivity of a given plot of land, raising the economic output of a farm, and improving living conditions for those associated with its production. Improving the quality of the coffee has directly lead to the growth of Rwandas GDP, and eased many of the land pressures that caused so many problems in the past.
The Abakundakawa co-op that produced our latest offering is a great example of how much Rwandas coffee producing sector has evolved in the last decade and a half and the positive benefits it has generated. This co-op represents farmers working the slopes of the high mountains in the Gakenke district. It was founded in 2004 originally representing 180 growers, but the intervening decade has seen astounding growth with nearly 2000 farmers bringing their coffee into the co-ops two washing stations.
At these washing stations the fruit is carefully sorted to winnow out any underripe or overripe fruit. The coffee is then pulped and put in fermentation tanks for 12 hours, after which it is rinsed, soaked again, and then dried on raised beds. From there the dried coffee is sent to the capital, Kigali, where it is graded and made ready for export.
One of the main focuses of Abakundakawa is empowering the women in their communities. Women produce as much as 2/3 of the co-ops coffee harvest and have two prominent associations within the co-op, Duhingekawa and Abanyameraka. These associations ensure that women have an equal voice in the co-ops democratic structure, and have helped to create tailoring centers to provide income for the communitys women outside of coffee.
Abakundakawa is also committed to helping grow the regions food security and overall health. In partnership with international NGOs the co-op has helped to bring fresh water to its communities, most notably a local hospital that lacked this vital resource. It has also provided member farmers with dairy cattle, in exchange for giving the first calf back to the co-op. This adds another economic and nutritive resource to the farmers lives, as well as providing them with valuable manure which in turn improves the quality of the coffee crop.
The lot we purchased from Abakundakawa came to us by way of Sustainable Harvest, a coffee importer here in Portland. As part of their commitment to fostering traceability and transparency throughout the coffee supply chain they maintain offices and staff in Kigali to work directly with the many co-ops that are producing wonderful coffees there. This lot features incredible cane syrup sweetness and complex spice notes reminiscent of cola, complemented by a pleasantly crisp acidity and hints of delicate, floral anise. This is one of those coffees that is sure to have something new and unique to bring to the table no matter how it is brewed!

Gesha varietal coffees are among the worlds most prized, and the Geshas produced by Granja La Esperanza of Colombia stand among the best of the best. This type of Arabica stems from the work of a group of agronomists in Ethiopia in the early 20th century searching for disease resistant heirloom varietals of coffee. One of the varietals they brought to Latin America came from near the town of Gesha, and bore that name. It was originally planted in Costa Rica, and although it tasted very unique it proved difficult to grow and low yielding. In the coffee market of the time, unique flavor wasnt exactly a sought after attribute, and high yields were king.A few farmers kept Geshas as curios and oddities, but the first to have any commercial success with the varietal was the Peterson family of Boquete, Panama. Starting in 2004, Gesha lots from the Petersons farm Hacienda La Esmerelda started winning awards (notably Best of Panama and SCAAs Roasters Choice), and setting records for the price of green coffee. Lots of their Geshas sold for upwards of $100 per pound at auction at a time when commodity grade coffee was selling for less than one dollar per pound. Other coffee growers took notice, and began to start experimenting with growing Geshas for themselves. Among the first was Granja La Esperanza of Valle de Cauca, Colombia. They spent two years studying the varietal before bringing it back home to Finca Cerro Azul near the town of Trujillo.Cerro Azul sits at the crest of the Cordillera Occidental (the westernmost arm of the Andes), catching the warm sea breeze coming off the Pacific Ocean. Although they grow Gesha on some of their other farms, they reserve the entirety of Cerro Azul for Gesha production, and their most prized lots come from this farm. They measure every piece of climactic information they can, and have a weather station at the entrance to the farm. Every coffee shrub on the farm is observed for both quality and yield, culling any that are under producing or producing inferior coffee. Fully 60% of the Gesha seedlings never make it into the ground from the nursery, meaning that only the healthiest genetic stock makes it into production.
Another measure they take to ensure the quality of their crop is the training they put their picking staff through. They only bring in their most senior pickers to harvest from Cerro Azul, and they have to go through a six month training process to be allowed to pick their prize crop.
We recently received 70kg of Cerro Azul Gesha from the late 2014 harvest, and we just started roasting it. This limited quantity means it will only be around for a short period. We are currently offering it in an 8oz pack size in our caf and web store ($25/each) and it will also be available at participating wholesale customer locations. Look for notes of hibiscus, fresh raspberry, lemongrass, and a delicate body in this premium offering.

Seizing the moment in 2009, WAC purchased a vintage, French-built 1974 Samiac roaster from a company in Switzerland, and set about building a new business around it. Having dozens of years experience in training and consulting in the specialty coffee industry, Bruce and Matt saw a great opportunity also to develop and showcase a retail and roasting business in same building as the American Barista & Coffee School, and share with new Water Avenue Coffee customers, the decades of combined experience to offer an unsurpassed level of support.
Starting a new company with the U.S. economy still recovering from the Great Recession might strike some people as unwise, but the owners liked their chances for success. Given that coffee is an affordable luxury the owners knew that if they prepared excellent coffee and built a solid stream of regular customers, they would be okay.
The father and son team'sconfidence was bolstered by its many years of experience working in and around coffee. Although Water Avenue Coffee officially opened in late 2009, the owners coffee experience goes back much further. Bruce Milletto is a Specialty Coffee Association of America Coffee Luminary, well-known for a lifetime of work shaping the specialty coffee industry. His passion to see the independent specialty coffee industry thrive is unsurpassed. He founded Bellissimo Coffee Advisors in 1991 and partnered with his son Matt to open the American Barista and Coffee School (ABCS) in 2003.
Matt Milletto grew up around the coffee industry and has worked in coffee steadily for the last twentyyears and has helped hundreds of small and large coffee businesses open up and succeed around the world. Since 2003, he has been teaching and training at ABCS, where he serves as vice president and co-owner.Matt is the current VP and incoming President of the Oregon Coffee Board.
Early on, Water Avenues owners knew that growth would take time. Not only did we prepare for slower days in the cafe and a slower growth rate, said Matt, But we also all worked hard to keep our costs down in all areas of the business. WAC negotiated a favorable lease and started building a much-needed third place for the neighborhood.
Before the caf was ready, the budding company found some wholesale customers, and roasted micor batches for a couple coffee bars, 2 pounds at a time.
When the coffee shop opened in June 2010, they fired up the 20-kilo Samiac and began experimenting with coffees on a larger scale. Water Avenues coffees quickly gained citywide recognition, receiving the Best Bean in Portland award for 2010. The next year, Seattle Weekly recognized Water Avenues El Salvador Pacamara as its Best Espresso of 2011.
One of Water Avenues challenges was to stand out in a city already saturated with great roasters and cafs. The solution? In addition to providing a great product, Water Avenue hires great people and treats them well. A big focus of ours is our employees, said Matt. Growing their coffee skills and education, and professionally as well.
WAC seeks out baristas who want to grow in the coffee industry, often choosing people with a strong work ethic and a positive attitude over those with long-time coffee experience. New baristas go through a rigorous training program, learning the finer points of coffee and honing their espresso skills. In addition to offering competitive wages and performance-based pay increases, Water Avenue also offers employees health insurance benefits and a profit-sharing program for employees, to give them each a sense of ownership in the company.
The most unique benefit for employees is a program that helps them travel to origin after working for WAC for one year. Employees get to see first-hand the impact that direct trade is having on farmers lives and the communities in which they live. Every year the majority of our staff travels to coffee farms (mostly in Central America) whose coffee Water Avenue sells. The staff explors the farms, visits coffee mills, cups coffees and learns about many of the challenges and opportunities for specialty coffee producers. They also get a first taste of some of the coffees they will be roasted and served in the WAC caf later this year, fresh off the drying patios.
Building close relationships with coffee farmers gives WAC better access to a wide variety of the highest quality coffees, something that excites the wholesale team, baristas and roasters at WAC.
The spark of inspiration that appeared in 2009 has grown into one of Portlands most well-respected coffee companies. In September of 2015, Water Avenue Coffee started roasting in a freshly remodeled warehouse on three new Proaster coffee roasters and expanded it's training lab and wholesale offices.
Its the culmination for all of our passions for coffee and our expertise of being coffee professionals, Matt said. Its allowed us to really do something from our hearts. We want to be known as a unique and genuine micro-roaster that started in Portland, in the heart of the most competitive market, that people appreciate for the right reasons.
By bringing together great coffees and great people, Water Avenue Coffee stands out for its incredible products and unsurpassed customer service, even in a city where great coffee is often just around the corner. We thrive on building long term relationships with our customers and wholesale accounts.

Water Avenues caf is a bustling hub of energy in Portlands industrious Central Eastside neighborhood. As the neighborhood transforms itself from a collection of uninviting warehouses into a vibrant spot for people to work and play, Water Avenue captures that energy and adds its own. Outside the shop, freight trains rumble by slowly, their engines raring to hit the open rails. Inside, the clamor from the baristas, customers and roasters charges the air with the excitement of a growing company.
A large blue neon COFFEE sign hangs above the pastry case, a symbol of the companys commitment to the beverage, and is a beacon for weary travelers passing by on interstate 5.
The large, open space easily accommodates all types of people. Workers from nearby offices, seeking a brief escape from their cubicles, gather along the high tables, chatting loudly. Tourists sit at the bar, contemplating the beauty of the space while sipping their cappuccinos. In the corner, a digital design specialist stares intensely into her laptop screen, pouring over revisions to her latest project.
Our roastery and wholesale warehouse is located at 1215 SE 8th, on the corner of 8th and SE Main, just blocks away from our cafe. At over 4000 sq. ft. we have a glistening loft style warehouse with 2 production roasters, green coffee storage, our offices as well as a dedicated training lab for our wholesale accounts and staff.
Water Avenue roasts coffee 6 days a week, and visitors stop by Sunday-Friday and enjoy the sights and smells of multiple Proaster roasters as they transform batches of pale green beans into aromatic brown gems. This glimpse behind the curtain allows people to see the care that goes into making specialty coffee special.
With excellent customer service, meticulous roasting and well-trained baristas that care about making a quality product, Water Avenue Coffee will be an anchor destination in Portlands Central Eastside district for years to come, a place where people gather to savor great coffees and enjoy the invigorating atmosphere.

When you choose to serve Water Avenue Coffee in your caf, hotel, or restaurant, you are entering into a partnership with a group of enthusiastic, experienced professionals who will work hard to make sure your business grows to meet your goals. It is our privilege to serve your needs very seriously. As a small, local company, we view our partners as an extension of our own brand and a showcase for our coffees. Your success is our success, which is why Water Avenue offers its customers more than a typical vendor-customer relationship.
Water Avenues commitment to quality begins with how we source our coffees. We search the global coffee market for the best green coffees available, purchasing only those that meet our high standards. Often this requires traveling to origin, so we can build direct trade relationships with farmers and help each other improve quality from tree to cup. The direct trade model cuts out intermediaries, allowing Water Avenue to send more money directly to the grower while paying lower overall prices for coffee.
We recognize the seasonal nature of coffee, and only source fresh, current crop green coffee. Our rotating menu of single-origin coffees lets you experiment with different flavor profiles and choose those that fit your customers taste preferences. If you prefer to offer the consistency of a blend, Water Avenue also offers its El Toro espresso blend, and delicious No. 7 House Blend year-round.
Each coffee is carefully roasted on our restored 1974 Samiac 20-kilo roaster in small batches, allowing us to closely monitor quality. To bring out the best from each coffee, we roast slowly at lower temperatures. This Scandinavian style of roasting fully develops the sugars in the beans with out over-roasting them. Although it takes a little more time, the difference in quality is worth it.
Freshness is critical to coffee quality, and to ensure this, we only roast your coffees after you order them. We manage our weekly roasting schedule to ensure that your coffee is roasted the day before it is ready to leave our roastery. We package our coffees in recyclable, compostable bags to minimize waste and demonstrate our commitment to sustainability.
Whether you are a long-time industry veteran or a brand-new caf owner, Water Avenues training opportunities meet you where your skills are.
Consistently serving great coffee can be a challenge, but our experienced trainers can help you learn the best ways to do it. We offer monthly training workshops in collaboration with theAmerican Barista and Coffee Schoolat reduced cost to our wholesale accounts. We also offer ongoing business strategy, finance and marketing advice, and general business guidance based on our staffs and owner's collective decades of industry experience.
To help you better understand the coffees you are serving, we also encourage our wholesale customers to travel with us to origin. On our trips, we explore coffee farms and visit mills, to see how coffee is grown and prepared for export. We also cup coffees alongside the peoplewho grew and processed them. The experiences you bring home from a trip to origin will last a lifetime. They give you a deeper appreciation of the effort it takes to produce a great cup of coffee and generate enthusiasm for you to share with your staff and your customers.
One of the most important decisions you will make regarding your caf, restaurant or hotel is choosing the right equipment. In addition to being a sizeable investment, the equipment you buy has a huge impact on the quality of the products you make. Our experienced staff can walk you through the decision-making process as you determine what equipment best fits your specific needs and goals.
Water Avenue has relationships with many manufacturers of coffee equipment, including Nuova Simonelli, La Marzocco, Synesso, Mazzer, Bunn, Fetco, Bodum, Hario, Toddy, and Urnex brands. Our relationships with these companies often allow us to source equipment, parts, and supplies at a wholesale rate for our customers. We also offer installation, routine maintenance, parts and emergency service through our wholesale departmenteverything you need to keep your equipment running smoothlyall in one place.

This week we'll be setting up shop on the cafe's North Bar to explore a few favorite brew methods and their effect on your cup of coffee. 
Tucked off of West St. in Annapolis, Ceremony's coffeehouse sits just in front of our roastery and offers a leading edge coffee and espresso program.
Hard to believe it's that time of year again! Though the weather hasn't given us a cold shoulder yet, the leaves are exploding with radiance, as is my family about the season's festivities. Commence with the texting! Though I'm not a big fan of holiday creep (Christmas in July, anyone?), past years of procrastination have left me scrambling. This year, I promised myself that I'll be different, starting with making sure I have the perfect coffee for Thanksgiving (Don't forget the Decaf either! Seriously, our Decaf Colombia is really good!). Thankfully, we're releasing our Holiday Blend 2015 this week, so you and I can check great coffee off our lists nice and early (Did you know most of our coffees taste better with almost a week of rest off-roast?). There will be fresh roasts every week through Christmas, so stop back often to recharge, as we're pretty sure your company will love this full, sweet, satisfying coffee!
To build this two-bean blend, we started with the idea that a holiday coffee should be well-liked by everyone in your house. We also wanted it to pair well with traditional holiday food, drink, and dessert. To do this, we began with our Ethiopia Wazzala Natural - a coffee with a big personality that brings a barrelfull of dark red fruit to the cup. Imagine ripe cranberries followed by a sip of red wine. Of course, every leading character needs a foil to bring out the best in both, so we experimented with blending several different coffees before striking gold with the Honduras Jaguar Land III. Though it sounds more like the latest B-movie blockbuster than delicious coffee, trust us when we say this washed Central just works as a contrast to its fruitier Natural counterpart. Adding a deep, molasses-like sweetness and warming spice aromatics, the Jaguar Land's deeply steady Spock plays the perfect sidekick to the Wazzala's flamboyant Kirk, creating a fuller, more complex, more satisfying cup. 
We wish you and your family a wonderful holiday season!
If you pressed me, I'd probably tell you that I prefer Washed coffees over Natural coffees ninety-nine times out of a hundred. I'm not trying to be a Natural hater. It's just that I enjoy Washed coffees' cleaner flavor (as a result of fewer defects and little-to-no fermentation), sparkling acidity, and engaging mouthfeel more. Every once in a while though, a Natural coffee comes along that tastes clean, berrylicious, but not too fermenty, and just incredibly delightful. Our Ethiopia Wazzala Natural is such a coffee, tasting of strawberry, cherry, and raisins, which is why I'm super excited about this year's version of Asymmetries!
You all know the deal - Asymmetries is a progressive espresso series predicated around two coffees, one washed and one natural. This year, it's the Ethiopia Wazzala Natural as mentioned, and the Ethiopia Beriti Washed. We'll start with a blend of 20% Wazzala Natural and 80% Beriti Washed, then subsequently shift the blend 20% towards the Natural every few weeks.
Why should you try it? Because Ethiopian coffees are some of the best in the world! Also, most cafes serve static blends, which are comforting and consistent, but a progressive blend gives you insight into how blending ratios affect flavor, body, and more. Look for your favorite cafe to carry the entire series so you get to taste the experience! You can also order the series online. Don't have an espresso machine? That's okay! I highly recommend our Asymmetries blends in an immersion dripper, press pot, or other steeping methods.
What to know more about the coffees? Check them out here:
Beriti Washed      -  http://store.ceremonycoffee.com/coffees/beriti.html
                              Character - Crisp, juicy, medium body, silky, citrus
Wazzala Natural  -  http://store.ceremonycoffee.com/coffees/wazzala_natural.html
                              Character - Sweet, creamy, full body, berries & cherries
V1, a 20% to 80% blend, leads heavy on the Bertiti Washed. Buy a bag here: http://store.ceremonycoffee.com/coffees/asymmetries_v1.html 
To get your mouth watering, here's what you can expect to taste in V1:
Fresh melon aromatics
Sweet chocolate and blackberry
in a crisp, juicy cup
You can see the Beriti asserting itself in V1 with the overall experience being on the crisp, juicy side. A hint of the Wazzala Natural sneaks in with the blackberry though! We think this version will make a beautiful espresso, Long Black, or Cortado. As the blend progresses toward the Natural, the body will get fuller, the taste fruitier, and the mouthfeel more mellow. This shift will take any milk drink and imbue it with the taste of berries and cream. I can't wait!
How did we extract V1? I'm glad you asked! First thing, age that roast to at least one week off. I promise it'll taste so much more flavorful once the degassing begins to subside! If you are pulling shots in its second week off-roast, try a 1:1.65 "Golden" brew ratio* in 27-29 seconds (no pre-infusion was used on our end) at a 201F set point. As the roast ages to week three, try tightening up your brew ratio to closer to 1:1.5 and pulling for 28-30 seconds.
Follow the entire series and let us know what you think!

With the doors at our Baltimore cafe now open, it feels like a good time to take a breath and reflect on the process. Our team at Ceremony has spent thousands of hours over the past year planning the space, training new baristas, and testing culinary concepts, all to bring Charm City denizens the cafe they deserve!
A key cog in opening 520 Park has been one of Ceremony's newest hires, the manager of our Baltimore caf - Jared Cate. Let's get to know this fellow a little better.
MH Hi, Jared. It has been pretty cool to see the hard work you've put into the cafe. Were you just born this amazing? What's your story?
JC Being a military kid, I have lived in many places. If you go by where I was born: Stuttgart Germany. If you go by where my parents are from: Tampa, Florida. If you go by most recent home: Boulder, Colorado. If you go by longest time in a location: York, England. (Is that a long enough answer?)
MH Wow. You're quite the globe trekker. How did you get started with coffee?
JC In college, I started drinking espresso drinks at a local coffee shop, and quickly came to the realization that I couldnt afford them, so I got a job there for the employee discount.
MH That sounds strangely familiar! So you, like me, got in for the perks. What has kept you in the game?
JC There are two things that have kept me in coffee for this long: The opportunity to continue learning about amazing coffee by being around it all the time, and being able to be a part of a community - making a simple but significant difference in customers' days.
MH What a guy. We're on the same page again. Customer experience is number one. Going back to your first point though - what is your current favorite coffee and favorite coffee of all time?
JC I currently keep reaching for the Ethiopia Wazzala. The depth of flavor and complexity keeps it exciting every time. My favorite of all time is the first time I tried a naturally processed Ethiopian Harrar. While it may not be my current favorite, it's definitely one of the most memorable coffee experiences I have ever had.
MH I think many people, both in and out of coffee, would echo your sentiments about that naturally processed Ethiopian eureka moment. I experienced the same deal with a batch brew of Wondo in NYC! Ok, few more questions. What is your favorite coffee ritual? 
JC I dont know if I have a favorite ritual. One of the things I love about the coffee world is that it is so diverse. You can have coffee in different ways all the time and not ever get stuck in a rut.
MH Great point! It really takes effort to make coffee brewing boring with how the seeds and the ideal parameters are constantly changing. Thanks for taking the time answer these questions, so we can get to know you a little better. What is something people might not know about you from meeting you in the cafe?
JC I have 5 kids! So far, they all like coffee, and my oldest boy is starting to learn to pull shots on our home espresso machine!
MH So if we run into staffing problems, we don't have far to look for new applicants! As a family-man and resident of Baltimore, what do you plan on bringing to your community's newest caf?
JC I want to bring an eye opening coffee experience to the Mount Vernon neighborhood, and Baltimore in general; not only though the quality of the coffee, but through the quality of service as well. The coffee world can sometimes seem unapproachable to the uninitiated, so our goal is to portray specialty coffee in a way that isnt off-putting, and gets people at every level of coffee knowledge excited.
MH I couldn't agree more. Specialty coffee doesn't have to be scary or intimidating. Rather, as our bag says, "Coffee should be something special" and the right group of baristas can make that happen for the folks of Baltimore! We hope you, dear reader, can find a moment to check out our new spot at 520 Park, and please feel free to say hello to Jared! Until next time, happy brewing!
If you ever tasted our house-made cold brew, you know how refreshing and drinkable it is. So why mess with a good thing? Well, after much experimentation, we've feel like we've done one better with a little help from our friends. Over the last month, we've been working with Oliver Brewing Company, Baltimore's oldest running pub and brewery, to roll out the first couple batches of our kegged Nitro Cold Brew. The feedback has been exciting - if you take your meals in the Naval Academy Dining Hall, you know what I'm talking about!
So what is Nitro Cold Brew? We start with one of our freshly-ground single-origins, add filtered, room temp water, and allot about a day's worth of time. With these fundamental items, we increase the recipe from a 1-gallon Toddy to a several-hundred gallon lauter tun at Oliver. Surprisingly, it's not as hard as you might think to scale up a brew - if you account for dose, water, temperature, turbulence, grind size, off-grind time, roast consistency, roast age, and a few dozen other variables! Okay, so it is a little tricky, but we quickly figured it out under the steady hand of Oliver's owner, Justin Dvorkin. From the a lauter tun, aka big metal tub #1, we filter the fresh brew, then nitrogenate and keg the freshly gassy coffee. Nitrogen has a very different effect on coffee compared to carbon dioxide. Instead of being effervescent, prickly, and slightly sour from carbonation, the nitrogen creates a creamy, velvety, slightly sweet effect. The gas you most likely know from Guinness and 78% of the Earth's atmosphere also serves to reduce oxidation, which in turn keeps the coffee tasting fresh and flavorful for longer. We've had kegs taste good over a month, which is considerably longer than regular cold brew left in a jar or pitcher. The best thing is, when you order a nitro cold brew, all our barista must do is fully pull on a stout tap to fill up your glass!
As you see, you'd be forgiven for thinking that this 100% coffee-based beverage is a beer, but watching the cascading bubbles is only part of the enjoyment. If you love sweet, but not-too-sweet, creamy, way-too-easy-to-drink coffee beverages, then our nitro cold brew is definitely for you. Come enjoy a glass today at Ceremony and at many of our wholesale partners coming soon!
Fictional cafetero Juan Valdez and his trusty donkey Conchita are the touchstones of Colombian coffee for most Americans. As they iconically ambled through my first caffeinated memories, I remember being struck by the humanity and effort signified by the characters. Millions now share in this association as the result of an incredibly effective marketing campaign launched by Colombia's National Federation of Coffee Growers in the late-1950's. Meant to differentiate the country's primary agricultural export, the characters worked so well that Colombia now sells the second-most Coffea arabica in the world, behind only Brazil. Indeed, if you've ever tasted coffee, chances are good it was from Colombia.
Though initially introduced by an advertising icon, Colombia is a coffee-growing origin we at Ceremony have come to know and love. The small size of most Colombian farms allows for highly-detailed work, like ripe picking of berries and controlled washed processing and drying. This extra attention translates to increased sweetness and higher cup quality all around. Most Colombian smallholding-producers own less than five hectares of land, so they don't have to sacrifice quality by attempting to manufacture large quantities. With a manageable farm, each producer or co-op has great control over their trees, harvest, and processing, resulting in focused, articulate coffees. It doesn't hurt that most producers grow the Caturra cultivar - a sweet, sometimes bright cultivar of the Coffea arabica Bourbon line. In response to coffee leaf rust destroying crops, we're seeing many, if not most Colombian farms now growing a small section of the Colombia and/or Castillo cultivars. Gaitana, Cedro, and Vergel are no exception. These two arabica/canephora hybrids were developed by Colombia's CENICAFE to have a pleasing taste and to be disease resistant - important with rising temperatures and shifting climate patterns making coffeelands more susceptible to disease. We're still missing a critical piece though - without which specialty coffee wouldn't grow at all. Great land.
Colombia cradles some of the most coffee-arable land in the world. With plenty of sun and rain, nourishing soil, high altitudes, and moderate temperatures, Colombia has all the requisite climatic aspects to grow delicious specialty coffees. Since this South American country straddles the Equator, growing regions are tropical and allow for two harvests a year (as opposed to most coffeelands harvesting only once). The main harvest here is called "Principal", while a second, smaller harvest is called 'Mitaca'. Equatorial latitudes ensure that temperatures, even at higher elevations, stay comfortable, warm (~70F), and supportive of maturing coffee berries. Bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, Colombia receives an average of 2,000mm of rainfall per year, which is critical for vegetative growth. The Andes Range bisects the country north-to-south with mountains and several active volcanoes. Over millennia, eruptions deposited mineral-rich ash about the topsoil, providing las cafeteras and their coffee plants a highly-organic, nourishing bed. Gaitana, Cedro, and Vergel all lie in the same lush area of south-central Colombia - and thus, each of these three farms/co-ops have the ideal general climatic conditions for producing specialty coffee.
The distinction between these coffees mostly comes down to microclimate, which can be defined as "a local atmospheric zone where the climate differs from the surrounding area". At its core, Specialty coffee is based, at least in part, on this concept of microclimate. The core idea being that "special geographic microclimates produce beans with unique flavor profiles". Erna Knutsen used these words to define and coin the term "specialty coffees" back in 1978! With that in mind, take a look at the details of each coffee, think about the flavors and body you're getting, then imagine how a given terroir might be affecting your shot. What is the aroma/flavor/density like? How does this change our approach to brewing? Does a higher altitude or lower latitude mean anything in particular in this case? Does the freshness of the harvest matter?

We entered the BWCA at the South Kiwishiwi (pronounced Kiss-is-not-better-than-Prince) river just outside of Ely. We portaged and canoed and canoed and portaged, and set up camp at the point that breaks open to Gabbro lake. The weather was wet. We were wet, and the water was wet too...
We are excited to announce that Dogwood Coffee will be expanding our roasting operation toWinnipeg, Canada later this year. We are partnering with our good friends from Canadaand look forward to growing the reach of our coffees and increasing our commitment to our talented and tireless producers at origin. This is not about USA doing business in Canada. This is a true partnership between friends in the US and Canada equally together doing something together that we could not do apart...
Groundswell became a wholesale partner with Dogwood Coffee in 2012. Over the course of the next year, they took a dying neighborhood coffee shop and expanded it into a larger space and a full-blown caf and bakery. They have super delicious cupcakes (vegan options too!), delicious and approachable food, wine and beer, and a full coffee bar featuring Dogwood Coffee. We interviewed Seth about his experience with transitioning a shop to a new coffee experience and his approach to food and drink at Groundswell...
Throughout the chain of coffee, each party involved relies on relationships that build each others well being, business, and create security and longevity. Even though we make great efforts to be involved in the entire process of our coffees, its the folks we partner with along the way that really get us a raw product of the quality and ethical caliber we require. Throughout the past five years, weve been really lucky to grow with some awesome folks in Costa Rica through our exporter, Exclusive Coffees. Heslar de Zarcero is a micro mill in the West Valley region and a key link in the chain for a few of the coffees we buy...
Even before this trip, one of the aspects of Ethiopian coffee that blows me away is the kind of quality and flavor profile that can be achieved from very normal coffee grown in Ethiopia. Other origins agonize over certain varieties and miniscule microclimates to pull out distinct floral, effervescent characterstics, while Ethiopian coffees inherently have these kinds of flavors...

White grape, cranberry, apple and canned pear cocktail with floral overtones.
Cascara is a dried fruit tea made from the coffee cherry that we love drinkingover ice all Summer long! In the washed coffee process, the first step is to remove the seed (which is the coffee bean) from the cherry with a de-pulper. Normally, this skin is considered waste, or a byproduct of coffee processing. It is usually composted for use as a natural fertilizer in the farm later in the season. To create this tea, the pulp is collected and washed and then laid out to dry. Cascara, which means skin or peel in Spanish, is a relatively new product in Central America, though it has been consumed for centuries in Ethiopia and Yemen. In Yemen it is called Qisher, and is often steeped with spices or ginger.
This cascara is from Finca Santa Lucia in the Llano Bonito de Naranjo region in West Valley, Costa Rica. It is 100% Caturra variety and 100% organic (though we cannot label it as such because our facility is not certified.) Ricardo Perez is one of the owners of Helsar de Zarcero, a micro mill we have been working with for the past five years, as well as the owner of Finca Santa Lucia. For the past three years or so, Ricardo has been working with the University of Costa Rica to develop a new way to do cascara. Ive been pestering him and following along with the project the whole time and this year is the first were able to offer the finished product!
Why is this stuff different? Why is it so yummy?!
Most of the time, cascara is created by washing the pulp and drying on raised beds in the sun, much like a high quality coffee. The thing is, its not coffeeits fruit. At Helsar de Zarcero, Ricardo has built an entire facility dedicated to creating cascara. The process is enclosed to create the most sanitary conditions. After the coffee is depulped, the cherry skins are washed with clean water and then go through a vaporizing chamber that heats them very fast and very hot to kill any potential bacteriasort of like a flash pasteurization. After this cleaning process, the skins are put into a large walk-in dehydrator to remove all the moisture. The process is very similar to large-scale fruit dehydration. The result is a super dry, super clean tasting fruit tea.
For details on shipping, see our Frequently Asked Questions!
We will be posting brewing recipes and some of the fun ways we use cascara on our blog throughout the summer! In the meantime,read more about our coffee relationship with Helsar de Zarcero on the blog.

Full bodied, tastes like cherry cola with hints of plum and bubblegum.
Nereo is a cool, humble guy. We have a lot of respect for him and the way he approaches coffee and life. He is hardworking and resourceful, using his own organic inputs from other areas of his farm as fertilizer, and harvests all his own coffee with his family rather than hiring pickers. For the past five years weve been buying his entire crop (only about 35 bags!) and it is consistently one of the most balanced coffees we offer. We've offered Nereo premium on the normal price we pay per pound for the past two years to help him continue his improvements and expand his business.
Nereo has been farming coffee for almost two decades--for most of that time he sold his cherry to larger buyers for low differentials. He teamed up with his neighbors at Helsar de Zarcero five years ago, which is how we met. Helsar de Zarcero is a micro mill in the West Valley region of Costa Rica that works closely with about 40 coffee farmers to process their coffees and create micro lots so these individual producers can forge relationships with buyers.

This coffee has warm flavors of cinnamon, almond butter and caramel with a long finish and full body.
Decaf coffee is a whole different animal, so we take extra care in roasting this coffee. The Swiss Water Process is a way of removing the caffeine from coffee without the use of chemicals; we feel that the process helps maintain some of the original flavors of the coffee and gives us more to work with in the roaster. Over the past year, weve been focusing on bringing in better tasting decafs by choosing origins we love and using higher quality coffees to put through the decaffeination process. This particular batch turned out super, it comes from the Guji region in the south where many of our tastiest Ethiopian coffees are grown.

Deep heavy floral notes like rose and potpourri with lemon and strawberry fruit notes and a hint of savory sage.
Suke Quto is a washing station and farm in the south of Ethiopia. This coffee comes from owner Tesfayes farm and 600 outgrowerssmall farmers in the area. Ethiopia is one of the few places where coffee grows wild, as it is the birthplace of Arabica. The Suke Quto farm is intentionally planted, but it truly feels like a wild forest of coffee. Coffee grows under a high canopy of native trees, which provide shade and nitrogen fixing for the soil. Sincerely, a beautiful place with beautiful coffee.

Orange zest and chocolate covered blackberry flavors with a pomelo-citrus brightness.
This is our second year buying coffee from Fernando Diaz of Finca Idolia. Like many of our budding producer relationships, we were drawn to this one from the cupping table. Earlier this year we got a chance to visit Fernando in Guatemala. Between last seasons harvest and the current, hes made tons of improvements to his operation, including new fermentation practices and built a super nice solar dryer for controlling the drying processa critical part of maintaining the inherent flavors in coffee and improving longevity (super important for us!) All of these improvements clearly show in the cup this year.

Finca Buena Vista is a very small farm in the western region of Ocotepeque owned by Juan Jose Alvarado, senior and junior. About 17 years ago, the land Finca Buena Vista is on was planted completely with potatoes; Juan Jose Senior wanted to plant coffee instead. The Alvarado family was already farming more commercial grade coffee at a lower elevation farm, but Buena Vista was planted with the intention of getting a higher quality cup. They planted the Pacas variety and in 2012 they entered their first Cup of Excellence competition and won 15th place, earning the second highest bidding price. We discovered them through their success with COE, and have bought small lots from their little farm for the past three seasons.
Check out our blog for more random thoughts on our visit to Finca Buena Vista a few years back:Western Honduras 2012-2013 Harvest

Well balanced and creamy with chocolate and nut butter flavors and a mandarin orange aroma.
Were on our third year buying coffee from Francisco Esteban Mejia! Ocotepeque a region is in the far western part of Honduras, right on the border of El Salvador. Francisco has been farming coffee there for the past 15 years; for most of that time he sold his cherry to his coop to be blended into larger lots. Three years ago, he wanted to follow in the path of some of his neighbors and try to find a direct relationship with a roaster to create more financial stability for his family and bring more meaning to his work. We found each other! Over the past year weve worked with him to find ways to evaluate and elevate the quality on his farm, provided feedback on his processing experiments and increased our volume.

Clean, juicy sweetness with mild acidity, pleasantly balanced with medium body.
This blend is like one of the mixtapes you made for the person you really like-liked, but didn't know very well. It is balanced, a little bass-y and a little bright. The components meld together well, and most people will like it. We leave this blend open to change depending on the season, our offerings and what tastes yummy. It's a crowd pleaser, or it's for that special someone that you don't want to scare away with either Norwegian black metal or Jewel.

This limited offering is a microlot created with coffees from three different producers in the Nueva Segovia region of Nicaragua in the very northern part of the country bordering Honduras. This area is oddly reminiscent of the Pacific Northwesttowering pine trees, rocky ridges and waterways and strikingly crisp cool air. After fermentation is complete, producers here sell wet parchment to a central mill for drying, which we think has a hugely positive effect on the quality and longevity of the coffee. Weve been increasing our buying in Nicaragua over the past year; this limited offering represents some of the highest scoring coffees from the area.

This cold brew takes its name from the famous Zamboni ice resurfacer. The Zamboni Company has a history of innovation in keeping cold things smooth. The family started in refrigeration over 90 years ago and as the popularity of ice skating rose, Frank Zamboni shared his ice-related talent by building the Iceland skating rink in southern California in 1939; later, he introduced the world's first ice resurfacing machine. Through Frank's persistence and commitment to the industry, Zamboni has become famous all over the world.  We hope that this cold brew can achieve some of the same goals. We want you to enjoy something that tastes smooth and delicious, and cools you down fast.This blend is specifically sourced and roasted for the cold brew method. The base is a natural processed Brazilgiving it a chocolate-toffee base, while the Ethiopian component gives it a higher noted, wild, fruity element.
To brew this coffee the way we think you should ;) you'll needto use one whole bag (12oz) to 7 cups of water.Use a coarse grind (like for a french press) and steep incold water in the fridge for 12-14 hours. Drain the brew andcut with 50% cold filtered water.
Add on one of our cold brew retail bottles to store (some of) your brewed cold brew! We can't send you our brewed concentrate, but you could use this bottle and pretend like we did. Bottle also works great for using as a vase for a few flowers, storing homemade ginger beer or kombucha, or shampoo.

The Hario V60 was created in 2005 in Japan. With a unique swirl interior, it appears almost alien, but was in fact invented by humans who figured out adding the sprial allowed air to escape, which maximizes the expansion of the coffee grounds. By far the most popular at home brewing method, the Hario V60 allows for versatility in brewing and pretty much consistently makes a kickass cup of coffee.
Youll need a few things to achieve maximum tastiness:
The Hario V60 works best for brewing a single cup of coffee. Our favorite ratio is 20 grams of coffee, to 300 grams of water. The total brew time should be about 2:15.
Start with a kosher sea salt size grind. If you are brewing more then 20 grams of coffee, coarsen the grind slightly and make sure youre brewing into a larger mug or coffee server. The brew time will be slightly longer. We use a coffee to water ratio of 1:15-1:16.
This is where timing your brew really helps! If the coffee brews too fast, youll probably also experience a thin/watery body, and light, underwhelming, slightly sour flavors. Fine the grind to slow down the brew process. If the coffee brews painfully slow, youll experience an increase in the body but probably some extra bitterness, especially in the aftertaste. A slight coarsening of the grind will help speed up the brew. Make small adjustments to start, and test the results.
Once you get close to the correct timing, your coffee should be pretty tasty!
** Use a burr grinder!Consistent grind size is one of the most important components to an even extraction and is most easily achieved with a burr grinder. A spice mill style blade grinder will not only give you a variety of particle sizes leading to uneven extraction, it will also be impossible to replicate the grind from brew to brew. Check out theHario Slimfor an affordable option that's great for travel (and an arm workout!)
Ok, Ive got all this stuff, now what?
1) Boil filtered water in the swan neck kettle. The ideal water temperature for coffee brewing is between 195-205F, but since you will be rinsing the filter with boiling water first, there will be just the right amount of time for it to cool down to the proper temperature.
2) While youre waiting for the water to boil, weigh out the coffee and grind it in a burr grinder.
3) To get the filter ready, fold along the crease and place inside the brewer. Set the V60 and filter on your favorite mug.
4) When the water boils, remove it from the stove and rinse the filter by pouring into the brewer until there is no dry paper. This will remove any papery taste, as well as heat up the ceramic. Make sure to pour enough water so that your brewer starts to feel warm. Discard the rinse water.
5) Place the Hario V60 and mug on the scale, add the ground coffee and tare. Shake the brewer a little to get a nice flat bed of coffee.
6) Start the timer. Pour about 60 grams of water slowly onto the ground coffee until there are no more dry grounds, with an extra pulse of water in the center to ensure that the coffee in the tip of the cone is extracting. You should see the coffee puff up, this is known as the bloom. If you dont see any gas bubbles or any puffing up, it probably means your coffee is on the older side as has already degassed.
7) After 45 seconds, pour slowly in the center to rehydrate the coffee bed, then continue pouring in a slow, continuous stream counter-clockwise until the water weight is 300 grams. This pour should take about 1:30 minutes. Pour slowly so the water level stays about an inch below the top of the brewer. Never pour onto the sides! The V60 is designed with groves that will channel the water around the coffee bed instead of through it if youre not careful. Ideal water flow is slow, but constant.
8)When the brewing coffee goes from a steady stream to drips, your coffee is done! The total time should be around 2:15. If the brew ends sooner, or takes a little longer, thats ok! Each coffee is unique, and the age of the coffee can affect the brew time as well, so sometimes these numbers arent 100% consistent. Give it a taste! If the coffee has a bitter aftertaste, try coarsening the grind just a touch. If the coffee brewed a little too quickly and tastes weak, fine the grind.
9) Lift the brewer off your mug, remove the filter and compost it. Now you can enjoy your delicious coffee!

A brewing device that's bound to make you swoon! Kalita offers us a stainless steel dripper that - like porcelain or glass - still maintains heat, is large enough to brew 2 mugs of coffee (20oz), and it's flat bottom design encourages even extraction.
Youll need a few things to achieve maximum tastiness:
We use the Kalita Wave to brew a single cup of coffee. Our favorite ratio is 20 grams of coffee, to 300 grams of water. The total brew time should be about 3:30.
Start with a kosher salt-ish grind. If you are brewing more then 20 grams of coffee, coarsen the grind slightly, and make sure youre brewing into a larger mug or coffee server, and the brew time should be just slightly longer. We use a coffee to water ratio of 1:15-1:16.
This is where timing your brew really helps! If the coffee brews too fast, youll probably also experience a thin/watery body, and light, underwhelming, slightly sour flavors. Fine the grind to slow down the brew process. If the coffee brews painfully slow, youll experience an increase in the body but probably some extra bitterness, especially in the aftertaste. A slight coarsening of the grind will help speed up the brew. Make small adjustments to start, and test the results.
Once you get close to the correct timing, your coffee should be pretty tasty!
** Use a burr grinder!Consistent grind size is one of the most important components to an even extraction and is most easily achieved with a burr grinder. A spice mill style blade grinder will not only give you a variety of particle sizes leading to uneven extraction, it will also be impossible to replicate the grind from brew to brew. Check out theHario Slimfor an affordable option that's great for travel (and an arm workout!)
Ok, Ive got all this stuff, now what?
1) Boil filtered water in the swan neck kettle. The ideal water temperature for coffee brewing is between 195-205F, but since you will be rinsing the filter with boiling water first, there will be just the right amount of time for it to cool down to the proper temperature.
2) While youre waiting for the water to boil, weigh the coffee and grind it in a burr grinder.
3) Place the filter inside the brewer and place on your favorite mug, mason jar, or fancy coffee server.
4) When the water is boiling, remove it from the stove and use it to rinse your paper filter. Rapidly pour the water directly into the center of your filter, avoiding the sides. The shape of the Kalita Wave filter is one of the reasons it extracts so evenly, so any folding would be a huge bummer. Once most of the filter is wet it will be safe to pour along the top edges to finish the rinse. Rinsing the filter will remove any papery taste and heat up the brewer. Pour enough water so that the brewer feels warm. Lift the brewer and dump the rinse water.
5) Place the Kalita Wave and mug on the scale, add the ground coffee and tare. Shake the brewer a little to get a nice flat bed of coffee.
6) Start the timer. Pour 45-50 grams of water slowly onto the coffee until there are no more dry grounds. You should see the coffee puff up, this is known as the bloom. If you dont see any gas bubbles or any puffing up, it probably means your coffee is on the older side as has already degassed.
7) After 30 seconds, start pouring at a quick, even pace, in a clockwise motion, until your scale reads 130 grams. This pour should take about 8 seconds. Let the water level drain slightly. At 1:00 add another 50-60 grams of water, bringing the water level back to the original height. Do the same at 1:30 and again at 2:00 (bringing the weight to around 250). At 2:30, slowly pour along the top edge of the coffee rim on the filter, washing those high and dry grounds into the coffee bed until you reach 300 grams.
8)When the brewing coffee slows to drips every few seconds, your coffee is done! Total brew time should be around 3:30. If the brew ends sooner, or takes a little longer, thats ok! Each coffee is unique, and the age of the coffee can affect the brew time as well, so sometimes these numbers arent 100% consistent. Give it a taste! If the coffee has a bitter aftertaste, try coarsening the grind just a touch. If the coffee brewed a little too quickly and tastes weak, fine the grind.
9) Lift the brewer off your mug, remove the filter and compost. Now you can enjoy your delicious coffee!

Roasting is the mark we put on the coffees we source, we translate the work of the coffee producer into the nearly finished product. The roast is a hugely transformative part of coffees path from seed to cup. Through heat, time and intuition, we transition the coffee from an ultra dense, bitter and fibrous state to a form we can grind, brew and enjoy.
We aim to roast in such a way that brings out our favorite flavors in each particular coffee. We never push our presence with roast flavor, but we have well developed coffees that are deliciously drinkable. No two coffees are the same; even from year to year the crop from the same farm changes. Roasting requires attention to detail and responsiveness to the changing coffee and environment. With every roast, every day, we taste and adjust and learn more about the coffees and the craft of coffee roasting.
At its core, roasting coffee is a craft and a science. In the real world, its a production job that requires responsiveness to an ever-changing product and a skill for repeatability and consistency. There is so much scooping and lifting and heat and noise and sniffing and frustration and satisfaction. We try to maintain a consistent product while being able to explore the possibilities of each coffee, and we do it every day so that the coffee were putting out in the world is as fresh as can be!
We try super hard. Please just like us. :)

Sourcing at Dogwood Coffee is based on three principles: Quality, reciprocal relationships and balance. Through communication, travel and the cupping table, we find delicious coffees and awesome people to work with that mirror our philosophies about coffee and life in general.
Quality is the driving factor behind what we do and provides expandable opportunities from the coffee farm to the brewed cup. In coffee, working for quality means access to sustainable markets and satisfaction with the work. There is little point in doing something without the drive to do it well, and in the end, were all interested in drinking tasty coffee.
Relationships are fundamental to our sourcing approach. We partner with producers, exporters, importers and other sourcing pros that allow us to participate in the process and forge meaningful, longstanding relationships. We travel to the countries where coffee grows to know the places and people, and to push the process of discovery. We are not afraid to cultivate new relationships with producers who have been where we have beforetrying to figure it out and do something new. Through building relationships we share in the risk of discovery and in the awesomeness of success.
Balance runs through everything for us. Our offerings are balanced yet interestingwith wild coffees that knock your socks off and coffees you could drink all day. Balance means that we step back and try to understand what we do in a global perspective. Coffee is the livelihood of and hugely important to millions of people spanning culture and economics, but we remember that people have lives and that what happens around coffee is of equal significance.
It is humbling to follow the process of coffee: a fruit that gets picked by hand on the other side of the world, pulped and dried, sorted and stored and sold, then put on trucks and boats to get to us. All along there are hundreds of ways something could go wrong, hundreds of factors that contribute to a delicious cup and hundreds of people intertwined. Quality, relationship and balance are on our minds as we buy coffees that help make us the company we are.

Were on to our second season sourcing coffee in western Honduras, and already Im really enthusiastic about how things have improved this year over last. Last year, we took a gamble on several small lots, and we were working within systems unfamiliar to us as well. Over the past year and a half, a lot of energy has been put into making this work and Im confident that were on track to a few long-term relationships with like-minded producers.
Last season we offered a coffee from Francsico Esteban Mejia. This lot was not a coffee we originally booked, but a sample I picked up from the Honduran Western Coffees booth at the Specialty Coffee Association of America conference in Portland. My activities on the massive show floor typically include: Getting a cup of coffee from one of the larger specialty companies that are brewing tasty stuff, slamming smoothie samples and saying hi to any of our green suppliers that may have booths. By chance, I picked up a few samples from Carlos Lara of ihcafe of small lots from producers who hadnt reached any buyers yet. Franciscos coffee was among them, and we liked it so we bought the lot.
Most discoveries we make about coffees that turn into relationships happen on the cupping table first. A coffee that performs really well and shows potential is one of the first steps to finding something that will work for usquality and relationships in balance. Knowing the exporter or supporting organization at origin and how they work with farmers is also important, and meeting the producer and getting to know them and their work is what ties the last of it together.
On my last trip to Honduras, I really felt like things were taking better shape. I had a better understanding of what needed to be done and communicated, the area from which we were buying coffee, and I was deeply encouraged by meeting Francisco in person and seeing his farm, Los Izotes. In return, he told me he was very motivated by my visit. It felt good to find a producer that was aligned with Dogwoods quality goals, and really seemed to have a passion for coffee. Francisco gets it, and he took a chance putting extra effort in to processing a microlot and blindly offering it out so Im really glad things are developing the way they are for both of us.
La Labor is a small town in the western region of Ocotepeque. Most of the coffee we have been buying is from this region, I wrote some about the first visit here. Since then, I have been back a few more times. Before stopping at Franciscos place this last February, we swung by the coop he is a part of, COCAFLOL (coffee lol! Haha just kidding) About 300 producers are members of the coop, and an additional 200 use their services for milling etc. Though we buy from many individual producers in Latin America, producers are sometimes still part of a coop, which can serve as a support system in ways other than pooling coffee together to sell. I discovered that COCAFLOL has quite an extensive composting program, which takes place at the millor the coop will assist individual producers who mill on their own and want to compost effectively.
In additional to the common California red worm compost, the coop was making an all organic, natural fertilizer in a method I had never seen beforeby fermenting the waste honey water in giant tanks with sugar cane and minerals. In wet coffee processing, honey water is the water and mucilage that is left over from processing. This water waste can cause a lot of issues for producers and the environment. If the waste gets into water sources like streams, rivers or lakes, it chokes up the water and kills off the things that are supposed to live, and the water is contaminated. It is necessary to contain the water waste, or somehow safely dispose of it. Mostly, I see areas of land that are just a swamp for the water, or giant deep holes/reservoirs where the water is meant to slowly seep back into the earth. The problem with this is that it takes quite some time for the water to soak in, and that space of land is virtually unusable.
Im not exactly an agriculture or even home gardening expert, so some quick internet research showed me that this process of fermentation for organic waste is widely used, though this was the first time Id seen it done anywhere Ive been for coffee. It takes some initial start up but it really seems like it could be one of the best solutions for taking care of wastewater in coffee processing. This article has some interesting information about some of the different ways the process is done. Its pretty easy to understand and I think gives a good general overview of how the process works.
At the coop, giant tanks are filled with the honey water and mucilage mixture, and then sugar cane is added to ferment the solution, as well as locally collected minerals. The minerals are added again roughly every three days, and the liquid ferments for 30-35 days. I was told the longer it ferments, the better. The end product comes in varying percentages of mucilage, between 50 and 90 percent. The coop packages the product in jugs and sells it for one dollar a liter, which is mostly to cover the cost of the jug and the process. Sale and distribution of the fertilizer is prioritized to coop members, but anyone is welcome to buy. In addition to the success of the fertilizer in use (Francisco used it on his farm, with great results), the process also saves the coop a lot of money. Most of the fertilizer, fungicides and pesticides that are used in Honduras are imported, and can be quite costly or entirely inaccessible for some producers. Not only is this process all organic, all the materials it requires can be found in Honduras. The coop has a few other sustainable/reuse processes for waste that I found interesting, such as creating gas and alcohol to power their small roasters.
After our stop at the coop, we went to Franciscos home to meet him and see his drying tables. He has been processing his coffee at his mothers house, which is just up the street, but dries the coffee in his own backyard on raised, covered beds. Though he is still a member of the coop, he has chosen to process his coffee on his own in the hopes of a more selective, and intentional process. He has been double fermenting all his coffee, a process he learned from his neighbor, Orlando Arita, who learned various techniques from a field trip with Counter Culture Coffee to the J.Hill mill in Santa Ana, El Salvador. We visited Orlandos mill and farm with Francisco so we could see how he learned the process. Orlando showed us everything he did, emphasizing the importance of every step, from ripe cherry selection during picking, sorting after picking, floating cherry, fermentation times and drying. The Kenya style process varies depending on who is doing it where, but it generally refers to a washed coffee style where the fermentation and washing process is done more than once. Typically, in Central America, the process is done one time with varying amounts of fermentation time hovering around 12 hours. With the extra dry fermentation or soaking times in the Kenya-style version of fully washed coffee, absolutely all of the mucilage is removed from the coffee, and the idea is that this will lead to a cleaner, crisper cup with possibly heightened acidity. The process that Francisco has learned from Orlando takes quite a bit of time, water and energyand weve definitely been happy with the coffee, but it would be helpful to know what the exact differences are in the cup between the Kenya method and what he would normally do. Francisco hasnt done a controlled experiment yet, but perhaps next year.
Coffee fermenting underwater. Orlando changes the water in these tanks every six hours to keep it fresh.
Many of the things that lead to great coffees are simple changespicking and processing only ripe cherry, for example. However, changing the culture of a place and a way of doing things that has been consistent for generations is more difficult than just telling someone maybe you should try this, it could be better, you could get more money for your coffee if it were cared for differently. There are other groups in Honduras that we are working with where these suggestions for change or ideas to keep the quality they have through the entire process are heard and understood, but the follow through isnt there. Carlos Lara of ihcafe described it as sort of a cultural disconnectspecifically in regards to the coffee leaf rust control. The sense of urgency comes when the problem is in full force. When I visited a year and a half ago, Ihcafe was conducting clinics all over Beln Gualcho about pruning, pest control and other issues with rust. Producers were learning techniques to prevent the spread of the fungus, as many of them had begun to have issues. A year later, howevernot much of the suggested action had been carried out, and now producers were really suffering. Many of these producers also grow other crops, mostly vegetables in Beln Gualcho, but coffee has still always been a part of their lives. Stillit is difficult to change a mindset and culture that has been in place for a long time from the outsidethe desire to do things differently really has to come from within the producer and within the community, as well as make sense for their situation.
Orlando Arita talking about the drying process.
Francisco is definitely one of the producers who has adopted this mindset. He thinks proactively, he understands the current and potential risks involved with what he is doing and he also has a connection and understanding of what the buyer is looking for. From what Ive found, one of the best ways to show producers that a direct relationship can be positive both financially and emotionally is to see that it works for someone else. Its difficult to convince someone to try to do something that is a lot of extra work and sometimes, risk, when there isnt a good example of success. Orlando Arita is a producer that has had a successful direct buyer for years, and it shows that the extra work he puts in is paying off. There are about ten producers, including Francisco, that he is helping and teaching better harvesting and processing practices so that they can keep their quality and find a long-term buyer as well.
The risk and extra effort involved in a producer going out on their own and trying to sell coffee to a direct buyer can be great if there isnt a secure support system. Some coops, like Capucas, for example, have great infrastructure and the know-how to develop microlots and work with individual farmers within the coop. Many other coops are not structured or dont have the desire to push this kind of independence, so producers are taking the risk on their own. One of the most difficult things Ive learned from talking to producers and other coffee folks who are trying to break into the direct selling/buying market, is the ability to reach potential buyers. On the two hour drive from Santa Rosa de Copan to San Pedro Sula at the end of my stay in February, Carlos I discussed the problem. He said that they were having difficulties finding ways to promote the Honduran Western Coffees brand (sort of a subdivision of ihcafe, the private producer/quality support organization in Honduras) to direct buyers. Setting up cuppings and sampling at the SCAA shows has done some to help, but the kind of buyers that might be interested in starting relationships arent necessarily the ones booth hopping. I met some producers from a coop trying to break into the specialty market who had attended the show in Portland, when Honduras was the portrait country for the SCAA event, but Carlos told me they left discouraged because they didnt find any buyers. He said it is hard for them because they dont speak English, theyre in a new place amongst thousands of vendors of every type, and theyre just waiting at the booth for potential buyers to come bytheres no clear idea of how to get the attention of roasters or boutique importers.
Ihcafe has also started a little coffee festival and quality competition once a year in Santa Rosa de Copan where many lots are sold, but usually only to buyers who attend the festivalwhich is after the harvest. Its hard for buyers to wait until then to commit to coffeesand its sort of a gamble then for producers who submitted lots for the competition. So, what is the best way for producers to find buyers and vice versa? Well, I dont know. It really depends on the resources available on both ends. I think that this is a topic for another blog maybe, but I have learned a lot from working with different types of organizations and exporters with varying levels of resources and staff. It has certainly been more of a challenge to do things on our own in Honduras, but Im encouraged by the progress over last year. Im very grateful in all situations for the people supporting producers who want to work with us and supporting us through the buying challenges we experience with being a little tiny roasting company.
Our last stop with Francisco that day was his farm, Los Izoteswhich is named for the Izote treea spikey, palm like plant which grows in Central and South America as well as the southern part of the United States. The flowers of the tree are the national flower of El Salvador, and are eaten in Honduras and other parts of Central America as a delicacy. Francisco grows all Yellow and Red Catua, a variety he chose to plant when he bought the land for the farm in 2001. I was both relieved and impressed as we walked down the steep side of the hill through the farmthe plants were lush, and heavy with perfectly ripe cherry as the pickers moved through to collect. After seeing so many farms in Honduras over the past year that are just ravaged by leaf rust, I was happy to see that Los Izotes had been so diligently protected. He told me he had been using the organic fermented mucilage fertilizer from his coop with much success, as well as customizing his organic inputs to the land based on soil testing he had done for the past few years. Though the bio-ferment fertilizer had done much to protect the plants from disease, he still manages the risk by diligent pruning and using minimal amounts of fungicide when necessary. As we walked, he pointed over to his neighbors farm which was just a handful of yards away, which was almost completely dead from leaf rust. The rust is spread through spores, which can make it very difficult to prevent the spread from farm to farm, but Francisco has been very careful and is planting additional barrier plants between the farms to keep the rust away from his crop.
Francisco has about ten employees who have worked for him for the past several yearshe prefers to have less people working for him that are more focused and understand the need for selective picking. Because he grows the yellow catua variety, the pickers need to be trained to know what a ripe yellow cherry looks like (deep yellow, almost orange)more difficult to determine ripeness with than the red. Lemon, orange and mandarin trees grow amongst the coffee plants, providing both shade and diversity for the health of the soil.
All in all, I was just really impressed with Francisco and Los Izotes, and it makes me personally feel really good to have something really working out after a good amount of discovery and work from all sides. Were roasting this coffee now, and it is available to buy online. Were currently offering a different, limited offering Honduran coffee at our shops from Edgar Enemecio Marquezbut well be serving Franciscos coffee when the current offering runs out.
If youre local, you can always order online and pick up at our warehouse in Northeast toodetails can be found on our Roasting and Shipping schedule page.

For the past two years we've traveled to Kenya specifically to source this coffee from the Kamwangi Factory, whose coffees have consistently cupped up as the best we've tasted from Kenya. In 2016 we are hoping to start a quality initiative directly with the New Ngariama Society, through which we hope to improve their drying tables.
This year a similar lot of Kamwangi placed 3rd in the World Brewers Championship, which is unusual, given that the winning coffees are generally naturally processed. A testament to the incredible cup quality of this coffee.

We are happy to be roasting this coffee again this year and look forward to it opening up into the Autumn and Winter.

Five Elephant is a specialty coffee micro roastery, bakery and cafe in Berlin, Germany. Passionate about quality, our goal is to source the best coffees in the world in a way that is both socially and environmentally responsible.
We strive to involve our customers in a conversation about coffee and are committed to sourcing the green beans that we roast in the most direct way possible.
Transparency is at the core of our values and we think there should be a clear understanding of the journey that coffee takes from the farm to your cup. Through this openness we hope to create sustainable partnerships with farms from year to year.
We dont just visit our partners at origin, but work to understand their processes, from cultivation to preparation. We are committed to innovation and will never stop working to improve the coffee that we source and roast, including our relationship with the farmers who grow the coffee.
Our belief is that by opening up this coffee conversation, we can share some great coffee in a way we can be proud of.

As of today, a portion of Intelligentsia was sold to Peet's Coffee, the "Granddaddy" of specialty coffee. Speaking for myself, this is an interesting and rewarding place to land. We've pushed really hard for over twenty years. This recognizes that we have transformed the landscape about what is possible in coffee; from the way producers are treated and remunerated to how coffee is roasted and valued, the feedback given to producers, to valuing and transforming the skill, hospitality, and craft of barista....Readmore

In the tradition of our other seasonal espressos, Fruit Bat has been designated and identified by an animal with a coffee personality. It is named for a suborder of megabats, sometimes known as flying foxes. These majestic creatures do not echolocate like other bats and feed exclusively on fruit and nectar. It stands to reason, then, that we attempt to craft this blend to mimic the sweetness and flavor of ripe fruit....Readmore

Intelligentsia was born in Chicago  in 1995. It was in the neighborhoods of this city that we grew and built coffeebars. Our success, fueled in Chicago, allowed us to reach other great cities as well. We feel indebted to our hometown and it will always be home. We probably wont build any more shops here, so we wanted to launch this shop by giving something back to the community and the city that believed in us from the start. ...Readmore

As Spring attempts to establish a hold - we're starting to seeing warmer weather in our home city of Chicago. Yes it snowed during the week, and yes you still need to wear a coat outside, but it still got us thinking about summer and things you drink and serve to help temper the heat. Few things do this better than iced tea. With a ingredient cost of $0.06 per 16oz cup, iced tea presents a remarkable simple and delicious addition to your menu at a great margin.

Last summer we saw countless stories about iced coffee in the press. Most of these focused on the various ways of doing it at home, but regardless, the popularity of this drink is only on the up. We use the cold brewed method in our stores, which yields a very dense, decadent brew.

Coffee comes from some of the most remote places in the world, and there are a number of key environmental preconditions that allow for the creation of incredible coffees: Altitude, diurnal temperature range, adequate sun exposure, good rainfall, and healthy soil are all critical factors that make great coffee possible. Follow the equator around the globe, look for places with elevations between 1200-2000 meters above sea level, and you will find the areas where top quality can be developed.
But having the right environmental conditions is only one piece of the puzzle. Most of the coffee grown in the world does not come close to achieving its real taste potential due to a severe lack of resources to finance quality operations, insufficient technical knowledge at the farm level, and infrastructure obstacles that cause major quality loss between harvest and shipment.
The only way to get truly exceptional coffees on a consistent basis is to work closely with farmers and millers in producing countries to help them overcome the hurdles that have held them back in the past. Our buyers and quality assurance team spend many months on the road each harvest season, working directly with growers to establish better protocols on their farms. It is an incredible experience to witness the transformation that can take place when a farmer learns to become an artisan rather than simply a harvester. Quality goes up tremendously, allowing growers to escape the commodity market and sell coffees that have real value based on their intrinsic merit.
Every country is politically, economically, and culturally different. Personal engagement with local farmers in each country is absolutely necessary. There is no single magic formula for producing brilliant coffees. Each location is a unique environment and has its own particular micro-climate, cultivating traditions, and infrastructures. We make several trips each season to every producing country where we work so that we can advise farmers and monitor quality from harvest to export. Over the years, weve formed meaningful relationships with growers in about twenty countries and will continue to develop coffees with them for many years to come. It is the ultimate study in mutual advantagebetter coffees for consumers, better prices for growers. We consider it an honor and a privilege to be the catalyst that allows this dynamic to exist.
Our Direct Trade buying model set the new standards in the industry. It is the result of many years of experience working at source and navigating the ups and downs that are inherent in agriculture and developing countries. The premise is simple: Engage producers in the quality process, control quality from tree to port, make it all transparent, and pay prices that reward outstanding results. But the actual work is anything but simple. There is a seemingly endless list of variables with which to wrestle. The odds are stacked against success, a result of decades of corruption and chaos in the local industries and a historically merciless marketplace that robbed farmers of the opportunity to be active participants in their own destinies. Since coffee is among the top export earners for most producing countries, it is no surprise that the coffee trade is extremely politicized.
To cut through all the uncertainty, weve created systems that allow producers access to the same information as the millers and exporters. Our transparency contract is an important tool that defines and documents costs and profit across the chain of custody. A tiered pricing system establishes a very sustainable base price and ensures there is a clear, tangible link between cup quality and coffee value. Together their use empowers individual producers to control the outcome of their work in a way that was not available to them before. When the possibilities are well understood, well defined and reliable, producers can make real progress in advancing their incomes and making coffee farming a truly attractive profession. And the better news? Most producers weve met really want to improve upon what they are doing. Theyve never had the proper resources and had never been guaranteed substantial premiums for producing higher quality coffees.
When we talk about relationships, we really mean it. Not just an occasional phone conversation or a handshake or a postcard on the odd holiday. It is important to develop mutual trust and to create a sense of actual partnership where one persons success supports the others. Since top coffee quality is such a delicate and fragile thing to produce, we must relentlessly commit to guarding and encouraging it. We typically spend time at each origin before, during, and after harvest in order to impact results and to anticipate hurdles rather than react to them. Ultimately, it is the farmers job to take care of his or her coffees, but we need to take an active role in helping them succeed. This means regular communication, feedback, advice, pre-financing, and training. It means being an integral part of the process.
When it all comes together, it leads to coffees that defy expectations and positively rewrite the definition of specialty coffee.
Coffee is such an incredibly dynamic and complicated beverage that attaining excellence on a consistent basis requires constant attention to detail and relentless quality control. Roasted coffee contains over 800 organic compounds that can contribute to flavor! More than wine, more than beer, more than Scotch. It is perhaps the most chemically complex beverage in existence, and to understand and control it, one must be committed to ongoing evaluation and study.
For this reason we devote a massive amount of resources to quality control. We maintain a staff that is dedicated specifically to quality investigation and analysis. Our baristas also act as satellite QC agents, tasting and communicating with our QC staff on a regular basis.
The method we employ most often to study and understand our coffees is known as cupping. This standardized protocol was developed by the coffee industry to allow for consistent evaluation of coffees in an environment where the variables that can affect coffee flavor are controlled to the greatest possible degree. Following these guidelines, we use a consistent water temperature of 97 degrees C and consistent grind and weights with every cup measured individually to within half a gram. Over the course of 40 minutes, each coffee is evaluated on the basis of fragrance (dry grounds), aroma (wet grounds), and a number of sensory traits including sweetness, acidity, body, flavor, and finish. Cuppings are conducted blind so as to allow for non-biased analysis.
Typically, we cup a few dozen coffees daily, looking at each sample from many different angles. Since the roast profile and roast degree play an important role in flavor development, we believe it is critical to view every individual coffee through many different lenses: sample roasts that are lightly roasted and provide an intense and clear expression of the coffee, production roasts of varying degrees, and coffees at various stages of aging. I liken it to the work of a marine biologist studying dolphinsto gain any real understanding requires intense study and observation over a period of time and in different sorts of contexts. Since coffee is a living, breathing thing, it will always change over time, and what held true last month may not be precisely accurate today. Thus, we have a great need for ongoing experimentation and study.
Sensory analysis is a delicate and sometimes elusive endeavor. To become a skillful cupper requires years of training and practice, just like playing a guitar. It means building a large reference library of coffees with a huge array of characteristics that will form the background against which new coffees are judged. It means fine-tuning the palate and teaching oneself how to concentrate at a very high level. Individual sensitivity levels are genetic and varying, but great coffee cuppers are not simply born; they become great after much study and experience. Thats not to say that untrained coffee lovers cannot detect qualityevery coffee drinker can taste the difference between coffees that are sweet, clean, and highly pleasurable and those that are bitter, sour, or lacking in character altogether. We all come into the world with the ability to distinguish a ripe, sweet banana from a green, immature and astringent one. Coffee is no different!
Coffee roasting is an intensely dynamic combination of art and science wherein a batch of raw, green coffee beans is transformed into a caramelized state which can be ground, brewed, and enjoyed. The goal of the roaster is to unlock the many potential flavors that lie dormant within the green beans to achieve a delicate, nuanced, and balanced cup that best showcases the characteristics that make each coffee unique.
We refer to both the machines and the people who operate them as roasters, and we couldnt have one without the other. Like a skilled painter or professional athlete, our roasters respond to a number of factors and react intuitively, drawing from their knowledge of green coffee and its inherent potential. As each coffee is treasured for its own specific traits and qualities, every roast is tailored to the individual needs of the coffee that is being roasted.
We are currently operating four gas-powered Ideal Rapid Gothot roasters at Intelligentsia: a 23-kilo and two 90-kilos in Chicago and a 40-kilo in Los Angeles. These machines date from the 1950s and were handcrafted from cast-iron and steel in Stuttgart, Germany.
Very basically, these roasters work by spinning green coffee beans in a large, continuously turning drum. This drum is heated by jets of natural gas, and the heat is never applied directly to the beans themselves.
A typical roast takes approximately 12-15 minutes to complete, and a number of chemical reactions occur during this process as the beans change from their original pale green to a golden yellow, then orange, and eventually a deep, chocolate brown. The temperature in the drum starts at 440 degrees Fahrenheit and immediately drops to about 200 after the green beans are added. This temperature is then gradually brought back up to 440 over the course of the roast. At about 380 degrees and approximately 10 minutes into the roast, "first pop" occurs. This pop is caused by heated water vapor rupturing the cellular structure as it leaves the bean. Aromatic oils continue to work their way to the surface of the bean, and a few minutes later, second pop is heard. During the final minute, the beans are skillfully guided towards a delicate balance of acidity, body, and flavor. When the coffee reaches this elusive pinnacle of development, the beans are released onto the cooling tray to halt the roast process.
Over the course of a roast, the roasters respond to both the machine and the beans. They are constantly checking gas levels, time, and temperature, as well as the color, sound, and aroma of the beans. A few minutes (or even seconds) too long and a bright, medium-bodied bean with distinct blackberry flavor notes becomes a flat, papery-tasting brew. A temperature too low and the oils necessary to give the coffee its flavor will not come to the surface and the end product will taste starchy and lifeless.
After having traveled from origin by boat, green coffee is trucked to Chicago and Los Angeles in 60 or 70 kilo burlap bags. When it arrives at our Roasting Works, the coffee is stacked neatly on pallets, which we unload and store in two-tiered racks. Green coffee can be stored in this state for up to a year, although we have made a commitment to offer coffees that are ten months from harvest at most.
After the coffee is roasted and cooled, the beans are placed in food-grade bins and marked with their country of origin and the date. Intelligentsias Production Crew either scoops single origin coffees directly into our bags or creates blends in 15-pound increments. Blends that are sold in larger quantities (our Black Cat Espresso, for example) are combined in a large machine that blends in 500-pound increments. If everything goes according to plan, we have very little surplus roasted coffee at the end of the day.
Much like a painter combines colors to create new shades and hues, Intelligentsias QA team creates blends that combine the most appealing characteristics of several different coffees. The result is a complete cup that offers tremendous complexity and depth, with the added advantage that as coffees change and mature over time, the blend can be reconfigured or fine-tuned to maintain a consistent flavor profile.
Every bag is roast-dated before it leaves our warehouse. Coffee this fresh is still chemically reacting and releasing carbon-dioxide, so each of our bags is equipped with a valve to vent the pressure created by the beans de-gassing. The bags are heat-sealed, rolled down and taped or tin-tied shut. Our coffee is roasted to order and shipped that same day.
We deliver and ship to coffeehouses, upscale markets, cafes, and restaurants once or twice weekly. Currently, we have wholesale customers in all 50 states, Canada, China and the Cayman Islands. This year, we will roast approximately three million pounds of coffee.

Intelligentsia Coffees buying philosophy is not very complicated. We believe in coffee quality and have made a commitment to our customers to offer only truly dazzling Specialty Coffees that speak for themselves in the cup. We believe that to get such coffees we need to work closely with actual producers, not just importers or exporters, so that we can build great coffees from the very start.
Intelligentsia travels to our coffees source each of the 12 months of the year. We visit farms, roll up our sleeves, and get to it. We take 24-hour redeye flights and 10-hour, high-altitude pick-up rides over serpentine roads. You pick up our coffee and we shake the hand of a farmer in Peru. Or Rwanda. Or Guatemala. And when you see the Intelligentsia Direct Trade logo on our bag, you know how much effort is invested in each bean.
In the broadest terms, these coffees should be understood as a true collaboration, with both sides investing a great deal of time, energy and ideas to produce something great. At the end of this process, the coffee farmer who grows an award-winning cup is an artisan, and should be regarded as such. We believe human effort is the most critical factor in quality coffee and that the growers who do the best work should get the best price and individual recognition.

Coffees designated as Intelligentsia In Season are less than 9 calendar months from the completion of harvest.
Coffee is just like great fruit and vegetables. Most coffee-producing countries have only one specific harvest season each year, and once the coffee is picked from the tree, it begins the inevitable process of slow decline, losing quality with the passage of time. The result is that no matter how great a coffee tastes while in its prime, the day will always come when it loses the very things that made it so tasty in the first place.
What then does Intelligentsia In Season mean? It means that our coffees are offered only while they are fresh and retain the vibrancy that both nature and the fastidious coffee farmer intended. It means that the coffee offers the same kind of compelling traits it did when we first selected it and brought it to our Roasting Works. The coffee industry has long perpetuated the idea that coffee is a year-round crop without recognizing publicly that the harvest cycles do not allow for this. So you really need to know when a coffee was actually harvested. Selecting your coffees in this way ensures that you are getting them while they are their most delicious.

True tea comes from the plant Camellia sinensis; the word sinensis is Latin for China. Scientists decided upon the name Camellia sinensis in 1905 and it was then included in the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. The tea plant is one of roughly 80 different species of the Camellia family. It is the only one that contains caffeine.
The Camellia sinensis plant has its roots in Central Asia. It is believed that this ancient plant probably survived the ice age on a plateau, possibly in Yunnan, China. The tea plant is an evergreen plant, meaning that it keeps its leaves throughout the seasons.
There are two primary varietals of Camellia sinensis and a third varietal that is a hybrid of the two primary varietals.
The most common varietal, which is responsible for the majority of the worlds tea production, is Camellia sinensis var. assamica. The assamica varietal was first cultivated in Central Asia. The name assamica refers to the state in India where Europeans first discovered it. The assamica varietal grows in warm, sub-tropical climates. Typically the leaves grow to be 4-10 inches in length. Although they are most often grown as bushes about 3 feet tall, the trees can grow to be 50 feet tall. The assamica plant grows rapidly in warm, humid conditions. Assamica tea is grown in India, Western China, Africa, Vietnam, Thailand, Turkey, Sri Lanka, and even in parts of South America. Assamica is mostly used for making black tea through the CTC (Cut Tear Curl) method of processing; its an extremely cheap and productive plant. At low elevations assamica plants can be harvested every 10 days year round; at higher altitudes they are picked 5-7 times a year. Typically, assamica plants contain more caffeine and polyphenols than other tea varietals. Assamica teas can be very bitter and astringent if processed incorrectly or picked too early.
The second most common varietal is Camellia sinensis var. sinensis. This varietal has smaller leaves compared to the assamica plant. The leaves grow to 3-5 inches in length at maturity. In the wild, sinensis plants can grow to be 30 feet tall. They grow more slowly at higher altitudes. Sinensis plants grow throughout Central and Eastern China, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. The slow growth cycle means that they are harvested only 4 or 5 times a year. Some sinensis plants can handle frost, but they are more productive and grow much more quickly in warmer weather. The best quality sinensis plants can absorb massive amounts of nitrogen from the soil and produce teas with large amounts of amino acids. These teas are unmatched in body and mouthfeel.
The third hybrid varietal Camellia sinensis var. cambodia is grown through Indonesia. It is very productive and pest resistant. Most tea from these plants is used for CTC teas. Intelligentsia doesnt purchase this varietal due to its common, unremarkable quality.

"Volta has flown the orange and grey colors of Intelligentsia from the moment we conceived of the shop. In fact, Volta wouldn't be what it is today without the help of so many people from the Intelligentsia organization. The Intelli staff are more than a company that roasts our coffee: from Southeast sales rep Chris Clements, to trainers who have worked with us in our shop, in Chicago, and through email and phone support, to sales staff and technical support, the people behind the scenes at Intelligentsia have provided professional support that has allowed us to excel.
They are industry leaders who have challenged us to push the boundaries of what a small, independent shop in a tertiary market can accomplish. That, and the coffees just keep getting better and better. Geoff Watts oversees a staff of green coffee buyers, QC evaluators, and roasters that not only delivers consistently amazing coffees, but they are literally pushing the envelope for quality at all steps of the supply chain, from farm to cup."

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

This year, they chose to use our Los Delirios, Nicaragua as the coffee to include in their Bourbon County Stout. We wanted to commemorate that this year by collaborating on a mug and custom bag for this year's edition. These are extremely limited, you'll be getting a 12oz bag of Los Delirios in a custom designed bag as well as a coffee mug with Los Delirios and Bourbon County Stout logos on either side.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

We've pushed really hard for over twenty years.

In the tradition of our other seasonal espressos, Fruit Bat has been designated and identified by an animal with a coffee personality. It is named for a suborder of megabats, sometimes known as flying foxes. These majestic creatures do not echolocate like other bats and feed exclusively on fruit and nectar. It stands to reason, then, that we attempt to craft this blend to mimic the sweetness and flavor of ripe fruit....Readmore

Soaking ground coffee and water in a container overnight and filtering through a thick cotton pad produces a concentrate that can be added to hot or cold water to make individual cups of coffee. Cold brewing extracts the desirable flavor compounds (and the caffeine) but leaves behind many of the oils and fatty acids that give hot brewed coffee the familiar bite and make it difficult for some people to digest. When stored in the refrigerator, this concentrate has a shelf life of 14 days. Makes about 48 oz. of coffee concentrate per brew.

Over the years, we have experimented with many different methods for brewing single cups of coffee, and the Hario Ceramic Dripper produces amazing results. The angle of the cone, the large hole at the bottom, and the ribbing on the side walls all help to ensure a good extraction. This size works best for 10 to 16 ounces of brewed coffee.

This Privacy Policy applies to the Site. This Privacy Policy does not necessarily apply to any offline collection of your personal information. Please see below for details.
We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices on any web site not operated by Intelligentsia Coffee, Inc. to which the Site links or that links to the Site.

INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
1.  Information Collection.
We collect information from you in several different ways on this Site. We may collect any content, record, or electronic communication of any kind, including without limitation your (1) contact information, (2) financial information, (3) demographic information, and (4) other personal information required to process your application to request services from us, so that we may provide you with the information or services that you request, and so that we may communicate with you and send you information and materials for marketing and other purposes, subject to applicable laws and the terms of the Privacy Policy.
One goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide an efficient, meaningful, and customized experience. For example, we can use your personal information to:
 help make the Site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.
 help you quickly find information, products, and services.
 help us create content that is most relevant to you.
 alert you to new information, products, and services that we offer.
(a) Registration and Ordering. Before using certain parts of any Site or ordering products, you must complete an online registration form. During registration, you will be prompted to provide to us certain personal information, including but not limited to your name, shipping and billing address(es), phone number(s), email address, and credit card number. These kinds of personal information are used for billing purposes, to fulfill your orders, to communicate with you about your order and the Sites, and for internal marketing purposes. If we encounter a problem when processing your order, your personal information may be used to contact you.
(b) Email Addresses. Several locations of the Site permit you to enter your email address for purposes including but not limited to: to register for a contest or sweepstakes; to request us to notify you of new products; to sign up for email newsletters and special offers. Your participation in a contest or sweepstakes is completely voluntary, so you have a choice whether to participate and disclose information to us. We use this information to notify contest and sweepstakes winners and to award prizes. By entering a contest or sweepstakes, you may be opting in to receive our email newsletter and special offers and this will be disclosed in the official rules governing the contest or sweepstakes.
(c) Cookies and Other Technology. Like many sites, the Site employs cookies and web beacons (also known as clear GIF technology or action tags) to speed your navigation of the Site, recognize you and your access privileges, and track your Site usage.
(i) Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored as text files by your Internet browser on your computers hard drive. Most Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from web sites or to remove cookies from your hard drive, but if you do, you will not be able to access or use portions of the Site. We have to use cookies to enable you to select products, place them in an online shopping cart, and to purchase those products. If you do this, we keep a record of your browsing activity and purchase. THE SITES COOKIES DO NOT AND CANNOT INFILTRATE A USERS HARD DRIVE TO GATHER A USERS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Our cookies are not spyware.
(ii) Web beacons assist in delivering cookies and help us determine whether a web page on the Site has been viewed and, if so, how many times. For example, any electronic image on the Site, such as an ad banner, can function as a web beacon.
(iii) We may use third-party advertising companies to help tailor site content to users or to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and web beacons to measure advertising effectiveness (such as which web pages are visited or what products are purchased and in what amount). Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any personal information collected by us.
(iv) As an example, Facebook collects certain information via cookies and web beacons to determine which web pages are visited or what products are purchased. Please note that any information collected by Facebook via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any customer's personal information collected by us.
(d) Log Files. As is true of most web sites, the Site server automatically recognizes the Internet URL from which you access the Site. We may also log your Internet protocol (IP) address, Internet service provider, and date/time stamp for system administration, order verification, internal marketing, and system troubleshooting purposes. (An IP address may indicate the location of your computer on the Internet.) IP addresses are not used to track a users session. This information only helps us determine how often different areas of our Site are visited. We do not link IP address to any information that is personally identifiable.
2.  Information Use and Disclosure.
(a) Internal Use. We use your personal information to process your order and provide you with customer service. We may internally use your personal information to improve the Sites content and layout, to improve outreach and for our own marketing efforts (including marketing our services and products to you), and to determine general marketplace information about visitors to the Site.

(b) Communications with You: We will use your personal information to communicate with you about the Site and your orders and deliveries. Also, we may send you a confirmation email when you register with us.

Also, you may submit your email address for reasons such as to register for a contest or sweepstakes; to request us to notify you of products; to sign up for email newsletters and special offers. If you submit your email address, we use it to deliver the information to you. We always permit you to unsubscribe or opt out of future emails (see the opt out section, below, for more details). Because we have to communicate with you about orders that you choose to place, you cannot opt out of receiving emails related to your orders.
(c) External Use. We want to provide you with excellent service and to offer you a great selection. We do not sell, rent, trade, license or otherwise disclose your specific personal information or financial information to anyone other than to affiliates under Intelligentsia Coffee, Inc.s control, except that:
(i) As do most Internet retailers, we sometimes use others to perform specific functions on our behalf. When we disclose information to these service providers, we disclose information to help them to perform their service. For example, in order to deliver products to you, we must share some information. We partner with third parties (such as the U.S. Postal Service and United Parcel Service to ship products, to ensure delivery, and so that we can obtain feedback, improve the quality of our service, and measure and improve the quality of the service of the third party. In the example of shippers, we provide them some personally identifiable information such as your name, shipping address, email, and phone number.
(ii) Similarly, to help you buy products and provide customer service to you, we must provide your credit card number to financial-services corporations such as credit-card processors and issuers. When we submit your credit card number for authorization, we use state-of-the-art data encryption to protect your information. (More on this below in Data Security.)
(iv) We may disclose such information in response to requests from law enforcement officials conducting investigations; subpoenas; a court order; or if we are otherwise required to disclose such information by law. We also will release personal information where disclosure is necessary to protect our legal rights, enforce our Terms of Service or other agreements, to operate the Site or to protect ourselves or others. For example, we may share information to reduce the risk of fraud or if someone uses or attempts to use the Site for illegal reasons or to commit fraud.
(v) We will not sell (or trade or rent) personally identifiable information to other companies as part of our regular course of business. However, its possible that we might acquire or merge with or be acquired by another company or that we might dispose of some or all of our assets. If that happens, your personal information may be disclosed to another company, but that disclosure will be subject to the Privacy Policy then in effect.
(vi) We may share non-personal information (such as the number of daily visitors to a particular web page, or the size of an order placed on a certain date) with third parties such as advertising partners. This information does not directly personally identify you or any user.
(vii) We may publicly disclose the name, city, and state of the contest and sweepstakes winners.
(viii) In addition, we may use and share aggregated information that does not uniquely identify you when it enables us to improve and enrich our services and the Sites content.
We maintain full rights to any information collected on this website, and may freely collect, use and disclose such information unless prohibited by this Privacy Policy or applicable law.
DATA SECURITY
The Site incorporates physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, including Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for all financial transactions through the Site. We use SSL encryption to protect your personal information online, and we also take several steps to protect your personal information in our facilities. Access to your personal information is restricted. Only employees who need access to your personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to your personal information. Finally, we rely on third-party service providers for the physical security of some of our computer hardware. We believe that their security procedures are adequate. For example, when you visit the Site, you access servers that are kept in a secure physical environment, behind a locked cage and an electronic firewall.
While we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information, we cannot guarantee complete security. 100% complete security does not presently exist anywhere online or offline.
OPT OUT/CORRECTIONS
Upon your request, we will (a) correct or update your personal information; (b) stop sending emails to your email address; and/or (c) disable your account to prevent any future purchases through that account. You can make these requests at the contact us section of the Site http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/contact-us, or by telephoning, or emailing your request to intelligentsiacoffee.coms Customer Service Team 1-888-945-9786 or:

ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
If you wish to have access to your personal information in our records, please contact us with your request at customersupport@intelligentsiacoffee.com. You may also request that we update your personal information or correct any factual errors that you believe may exist regarding this information.
OFFLINE COLLECTION, USE & DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
As you might expect from us, the majority of information that we collect is obtained through the Site, and this Privacy Policy applies only to that online collection of personal information. We also may collect information offline, where we also try to protect the privacy of your personal information. One example involves someone calling us to place an order or to ask questions. When someone calls, we will ask only for the personal information we need in order to place the order or to answer the question. When we need to store information (such as order information), we will enter it into our database through SSL encryption. (See the Data Security section above for more information). Another example involves faxes. If you fax something to us, we will act upon the fax and then either store it a locked repository or we will shred the fax if there is no need to retain the information. There are other ways we could learn of personal information offline (for example, we suppose someone could send us a letter including some return address information), and this Policy doesnt discuss or try to predict all of those methods or uses. As we mentioned, we will try to treat offline collection, uses, and disclosures consistently with our relevant online practices.
ACCESS BY CHILDREN:
This website is not directed toward children under 13 years of age and Intelligentsia Coffee, Inc. does not knowingly collect or use information from children under 13 through this website.

Joe was founded in 2003 as a singular specialty coffee house in manhattans west village with the simple vision of brewing the highest quality, unique coffees and serving them with unsurpassed hospitality and knowledge.  in order to bring such highly curated coffees to our customers, we worked alongside some of the most renowned domestic and international roasteries.
with the july 2013 launch of our own roasting operations in red hook, brooklyn, we now roast 100% of our own single-origin and blended offerings.  whether in the roastery or in one of our now 10 cafes, we strive to effect our deeply rooted core value proposition: the desire to build, maintain and strengthen community at every level from producer to customer. 
4 points of joe roasting's buying philosophy
1) fair and traceable
at joe, we are committed to making certain that every green coffee transaction is both fair and traceable.  in addition to purchasing coffee directly from producers, joe also works with importers, exporters and brokers who are equally committed to selling coffee that can be traced back to the farmer, group, or cooperative.  through a traceable supply chain, we can ensure that farmers are paid well above both commodity prices and fair trade minimums for the coffees we buy.
2) quality
the joe sourcing and selection team maintains stringent standards when selecting green coffee for our menu.  all beans, from the components of our House Selection to our rotating cast of single origin coffees, have met or exceeded our intense quality standards.  joes quality protocols require cupping (tasting) hundreds of samples of coffee per year, maintaining a seasonal rotation of beans, and working with importers and exporters who use the utmost care in transporting and storing the coffee.
3) flexibility
joe is committed to flexibility when purchasing green coffee. we understand that each and every coffee producing country has its own unique purchasing infrastructure.  while joe works directly with farmers or cooperatives when possible, we also embrace other forms of ethical sourcing already established in certain regions.  some of the coffee we buy is certified fair trade, organic or shade grown, but our purchases are not limited to farms that have secured such certifications.
4) sustainable relationships
joe strives to build sustainable and trusting relationships with importers, exporters, brokers and farmers. working with many of the same individuals each year can guarantee both quality coffee for joe and stability for our wholesale partners.  additionally, relationships with importers and brokers formed on a trusting foundation help us to perennially source only the best coffee from around the world.

We are excited to announce the release of three fantastic microlots being brewed at Joe beginning September 1st.  This coffee release is unlike any we've done before in that you'll find different coffees at each store. Travel around the city (or to Philly!), fill out your microlot passport punch card, and receive a free drink of your choice! (Cards are available on the counter at each location.)
Each Microlot Monday (and Saturday), one of these coffees will be available as a featured brew at each Joe location. Check the brew schedules below, or keep an eye on our Facebook or Twitter feeds, to find out how to tour all three of these truly special coffees (and of coursefinish your card.)
The term microlot is one given to a small amount of coffee that is of superior quality and has been reserved out of the larger harvest by the farmer.  It could be that a microlot is a small section of one farm that yields a particularly special or distinct flavor so the farmer chooses to take special care in harvest and processing.  Due to the microlot's higher quality and the care taken in it's processing, buyers tend to pay a premium for these lots. 
Each of these three coffees came to us separately and each lot consists of just a few bags.  For that reason, we decided to do limited releases by offering each coffee at a few locations rather than offer all of them at every Joe.  Confused?  Below is information about each coffee and where you can find them!
Finca Grapos produced Ed's favorite coffee from his trip to Mexico earlier this year.  Ed says, "Finca Grapos jumped off the cupping table for me.  I couldnt believe it was a Mexican coffee.  It reminded me more of an Ethiopian coffee more than anything I had tasted in Mexico.  This is due to the varieties.  The two varieties that make up this lot are H17 and H19 which are hybrids of Ethiopian heirloom varieties and traditional varieties grown in Mexico.  These varieties have achieved the delicate balance between disease resistance and amazing cup quality; a very difficult feat."
Mexico Finca Grapos is brewing at: Grand Central Terminal, Chestnut, Upper East Side
The Red Catuai from San Jose was one of three coffees Ed and I loved and purchased from the Mierisch family on our trip to Nicaragua.  San Jose is the most picturesque of the Mierisch farms and the coffees from here impress us year after year.  The farm is lush with shade trees and overlooks the beautiful Lake Apanas.  We love the variety of varietals that San Jose produces and the amazing sweetness we find in these coffees keeps us coming back.
Nicaragua Finca San Jose is brewing at: Rittenhouse, 13th, Columbia
The Red Catuai from Los Altos (also a Mierisch farm) came to us in the family's Los Favoritos auction.  Throughout harvest they select their favorite lots to be sold via an online auction and buyers are able to cup all of these coffees together and then bid on their favorites.  This was my third trip to Los Altos and I am always amazed at how the farms change year after year.  The Mierish family is tireless in their pursuit of quality and are always looking for ways to improve their coffee with each harvest.
Los Altos Red Catuai is brewing at: Upper West Side, Joe Pro, Waverly, Chelsea
If you don't see the coffee you're expecting on Monday or Saturday, ask your Joe barista to direct you! And don't forget to get your passport card punched!
I flew to Tuxtla Gutierrez via Mexico City and met up with the Caf Imports crew during our layover.  Upon arrival in TGZ, we took a shuttle to town and got settled in our hotel rooms.  We had dinner at an amazing taco joint then went to bed.
Day 2  We drove from Tuxtla to Jaltenango.  The drive was about 3 hours through some pretty deep parts of Chiapas.  Jaltenango is a coffee town.  There are very few touristy things to see or do unless you work in coffee.  It was Disneyland for me!  We got settled in to our hotel and headed to AMSA (Agroindustrias Unidas de Mexico S.A.), an exporter that Caf Imports works with in Mexico.  They purchase dry parchment from farmers.  The unit of measure for coffee on this level is the quintale, which ends up yielding about 100 lbs (46 kg) of caf oro (green coffee).  The prices for certain types of coffee are posted daily right at the scale and are based on the New York C price.  Usually the coffees are weighed, sampled and purchased based on physical quality.  After that, the coffee is sent to the dry mill and port in Veracruz.  At that point, the identity of the coffee is pretty much erased.  This has been the model for decades.  Recently AMSA began keeping certain farms lots separated and began cupping them for quality.  They pay fair prices to their farmers and have many social projects for families of producers (including free eye exams and glasses).  They are always facilitating giveback programs for their farmers.
After our visit to AMSA, we drove to visit a member farm called Finca La Victoria.  We were greeted with an amazing meal of chicken soup and tortillas (they had probably killed the chickens that morning).  Don Martiniano Moreno gave us a great tour of the wet mill and showed us different parts of the farm.  Harvest was pretty much wrapped up so there wasnt very much action in the mill or out in the field.  The views were spectacular.  Don Martiniano spoke about how he relies on the people at AMSA to develop quality coffee.  He rarely tastes his own coffee and is still learning how to produce the highest quality.  We ended the day with tacos (of course), beers and some great conversations in the lobby of our hotel.
Day 3  I made an aeropress in the lobby of our hotel (no 3-prong plugs in my room), then we spent the whole day cupping at AMSA.  We cupped 26 coffees that AMSA and their best producers submitted for an informal competition.  There were some lovely coffees on the table.  We recupped the top 10 coffees.  After were got done cupping we had a steak dinner and an awards ceremony for the winners of the competition.  I fell in love with #2 from Finca Grapos in Siltapec, Chiapas.  He produces hybrid varieties H17 and H19.  It was floral and zesty.  After the party, we headed back to our hotel for more lobby beers and great conversations.  I ended up with the last few crumbs of the sample of #2 to brew the next morning!
A small group of us drove to Finca Santa Teresa to visit.  This past year the owner of FST, Ernesto Pohlenz Agliar passed away.  His family, with the help of AMSA, specifically Don Guayo Deleon has been able to get through this previous harvest successfully in the wake of Don Ernestos passing.  Don Guayo lead the tour of the farm.  We started the tour at the nursery where they are growing Mundo Novo and Pacas.  These varieties yield a higher quality cup and are more resistant to roya.  On the farm, Mundo Novo, Pacas, Typica, Caturra, Catimor grow between elevations of 1400 and 1600 meters above sea level.  Perfectly ripe cherries are picked, and delivered to the wet mill to be processed.  At the wet mill, the fruit floated to sort for quality (heavy cherries that do not float are better).  The fruit is removed mechanically and separated from the mucilage-covered seeds that are sent to the fermentation tanks.  They sit in the tanks for 24-36 hours before being washed using water through a network of concrete canals.  This removes the mucilage and prepares the seeds for drying.  On FST, they seeds go through a machine that shakes them to remove excess water before being dried in a guardiola (mechanical dryer).  The coffee is dried for around 7 days in the mechanical dryer.  After the coffee has reached the appropriate moisture content (12%) is bagged up and sent to AMSA. 
After our visit to FST, we met up with the rest of the group who were exploring another nearby farm (2.5 hr drive) called Finca Nueva Linda.  We were excited to see patios and experimental raised beds for processing honey coffees.   The owner of FNL, Juan Jose Moguel and his family fed us an amazing lunch!  They are foodies so we had a global cuisine for lunch!  The day we visited was the day of the ribbon cutting for their new cupping lab.  Juan Jose is one of the more cutting-edge producers in the region in that he is experimenting with different processing and he actually evaluates his own coffee on his farm.  He had a few people from our group fire up the sample roaster and cook up a few batches that we cupped right out of the machine!  I could make the story very exciting and say that they were amazing and wonderful but I dont want to lie, they needed some improvement.  You have to start on day 1 and thats where we were.  Juan Jose had 3 of the top 15 coffees in the AMSA cupping competition.
Day 5  We visited CESMACH, an FTO certified cooperative in Jaltenango.  We observed producers selling coffee and trucks being loaded and unloaded (via human).  Every coffee that arrives is sampled, weighed, smelled, roasted, cupped and milled.  Each coffee is traceable back to the individual producers.  We drove to CESMACHs dry mill were we would have another cupping competition of the best coffees in the coop.  We cupped another 30+ coffees and then the greatest hits which made for another very long day of cupping.  After that cupping we drove back to the main offices of CESMACH at Finca Triunfo Verde were awards were given to the top producers.  I gave some pretty high scores here but didnt fall in love with any of the coffees.
Day 6  Guatemala, here we come!  The trip from Jaltenango to Huehuetenango took 9 hours, which included driving, 2 ferry crossings and a border crossing.  For the most part, everything went pretty smoothly.  The bus became one of the best places for industry-expanding conversations with other coffee pros.  We talked about EVERYTHING from roasting, solubility, packaging, wholesale, sourcing, brewing, farming practices, processing, logistics, etc.  This became such a valuable part of the trip!  
We arrived at Finca La Bolsa in Huehuetenango for lunch before taking a tour there.  The farm is nestled in an amazing valley.  These drastic elevation shifts provide amazing microclimates, which produce a wide variety of profiles.  Renardo Ovalle is a third generation coffee producer.  His mother and father had lunch with us.  They were lovely people.  Renardo is also on staff and ANACAFE, the governing body of coffee trade in Guatemala.  Finca La Bolsa grows Caturra and Bourbon at an average altitude of 1450.  Cherries are depulped and coffee is fermented for 36 hours, washed in a very long canal and dried on a huge patio.
We stayed the night in a small town called Camojallito in Huehuetenango.
Day 7  Today we drove to a town called Conception Huista, which sits at the top of a massive mountain range in Huehuetenango at 2300 masl.  We cupped at the CODECH office, which is a cooperative in the area.  Caf Imports works with CODECH to purchase the best lots from the area.  We cupped 29 coffees and then re cupped the top 10.  At the end of the day, we drove down to Jacaltenango for an awards ceremony and dinner before retiring to our hotel, Hotel Florida.  This was a very long day of cupping and very little lunch.
Day 8  We drove to Huehuetenango City where I met up with Dan Griffin and Josue Morales from TG Labs.  I was sad to leave the Cafe Imports crew but we had work to do so I was happy to meet up with Dan and Josue to visit farms and their lab in Guatemala City.  Josue took us to Zaculeu, the highest ancient Mayan city.  It was nice to do something touristy and related to something other than coffee (just for a few hours).  That night me met up with a friend of Josues who has a farm called Finca Santa Rosa.  He gave Josue some samples of coffees for evaluation.
We spent all day at Finca Huixoc!  This farm is absolutely amazing.  Don Alejandro Solis is a third generation coffee farmer.  His grandfather purchased the land where Finca Huixoc and El Injertal are located in the late 30s.  He built a road and built the wet mill using mules to carry the equipment up the mountain.  Much of the original equipment is still in use at the wet mill.  Finca Huixoc is rumored to be the first coffee farm in Huehuetenango.   Huixoc has a very old wet mill and large patios for drying.  The dry parchment is trucked to Guatemala City where it is milled before export.  Alejandro sent us off with a few samples from Huixoc and one from El Injertal. 
Day 10  We drove to Guatemala City and visited TG Lab.  It was a breathtaking drive as we passed through different cities and drove by many different volcanoes.  We arrived in Guatemala City that evening and stopped by the lab before we went out for dinner.
Day 11  We spent the day cupping some coffees that Josue wanted to show me for consideration on our 2014 menu.  I found 2 coffees that would fit nicely on our menu.  We also cupped a few coffees that were from Josues clients and were candidates for the Cup of Excellence competition this year.  We fell in love with El Injertal, which used to be part of Huixoc and managed by the same family.  It is technically Alejandros sisters farm but they all run it together.  We also bought a coffee for House called Tres Marias.
Last day.  We visited the Lab again and Josue showed me some of the services they offer to their producer clients.  The amount of traceability was absolutely amazing.  He is able to build lots of the best coffees from each farm.  Each days harvest, fermentation tank and time, patio-drying time, moisture content, cupping score are all tracked and recorded.  The Josue helps the farms replicate factors that produce the best coffees and eliminate factors that produce lower quality coffees.  On the other side, he connects buyers with farmers and recommends the best lots, which he and the farmer have constructed via TG Labs systems.
We visited the dry mill, Beneficio Santa Isabel in Guatemala City where all of TGs coffee is milled and sorted.  The mill manager carries a gold-plated pistol on his hip.  The coffees go through many different machines to be dehusked, density sorted, screen size sorted, cleaned before they get bagged up and shipped to port.
This was a very productive trip for Joe.  We bought 5 different coffees from Mexico and Guatemala.  From Mexico, we bought Finca Santa Teresa as a component for our espresso, Finca Chanjul and Finca Grapos which were two of my favorite lots from the Lo Mejor cupping competition at AMSA.  In Guatemala, we bought a lovely coffee from Finca Huixoc-El Injertal and a wonderful House component called Tres Marias.  Watch for these coffees on the menu.
Keep an eye out for an event we will have at Joe Waverly. From July 1-August 15, photos taken from Amanda and Ed's last bean buying trip to Nicaragua will be on the walls in conjunction with coffees purchased on that trip! These coffees are from the farms of the family of Steve Mierisch, who also happens to own Pulley Collective, where Joe and many other great local coffee spots roast their beans.

Why youll love it: Generations of Americans have loved Colombian coffees for their balanced and smooth flavors. The San Roque is our interpretation of this classic and popular style, with exceptional sweetness and subtle flavors of citrus, grape, and cherry.
Story of the bean: Producers in the San Roque Association process and dry their own coffees and deliver them to quality analyst, Duver Rojas, who tastes the coffees delivered every day and pays incentives for the best coffees. Of 100 families in the association, this lot represents only ten producers who embraced these best practices. Their hard work on the steep hillsides unfolding below the San Roque Monastery and above the Magdalena River created this coffee of refined sweetness.

Why You'll Love it:There are two types of people, those who have had a life-changing cup of Ethiopian coffee and those who haven't. This coffee has a proven power to open your mind to the flavor possibilities of coffee.So whether this coffee is a revelation or causes you to reminisce, you'll love this coffee.
Story of the bean:The cross-pollination and continual evolution of heirloom varieties of Ethiopia create this wonderfully complex cup of coffee. After the ripest cherries have been harvested the coffee seeds remain within the fruit during the drying process endowing this coffee with a heavier body and an intense berry sweetness.
In 1992 in Ethiopia's Great Rift Valley anthropologists discoveredArdipithecus Ramidus, a 4.4 million year old hominid fossil. This fossil represented a paradigm shift in the understanding of human evolution and inspired the name of this distinctive coffee that changed the way we think about naturally-processed Ethiopians. In an ever-evolving specialty coffee industry La Colombe is proud to offer this heirloom Ethiopian year after year.

Why youll love it: Sweet and refined, this bright Ethiopian coffee will please the perfectionist in all of us.
Story of the bean: Yirg for Yirgacheffe, Z for zero defect. Ethiopian coffees from the Yirgacheffe region are world-renowned for producing distinctively floral and aromatic coffee. "Zero defect" means this coffee is triple sorted by size, color, and density until it reaches a point of near perfection. This new harvest is on a new level of coffee obsession. The mountains and soil of the Yirgacheffe region are known for producing coffees with floral and citrus aromas. Our importing partner, Samuel Demisse, has amplified this reputation by employing a rigorous sorting process in Ethiopia.
Workers at the mill are paid well to sort the coffee seeds by hand, meaning only the very best beans make it to La Colombe. This pure expression of these Heirloom varietal results in a coffee with the clean, pronounced taste of traditional Yirgacheffe coffees.

We are thrilled to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of Esmeralda's successes by sharing this coffee with you. With lemony acidity and jasmine-like floral qualities, this exceptional coffee embodies the profile of a Geisha we love.

Why you'll love it:With floral fragrances and stone fruit sweetness, this is a classic geisha that showed the world new possibilities in coffee. 
Story of the bean:A small area of coffee trees in Panamas Jaramillo highlands has been producing some of the best beans in the world for over a decade. When the Hacienda Esmeralda farm introduced the world to the geisha coffee variety in 2004, the Jaramillo lot was the original. With clean, flowery notes like rose and nectarine, this coffee represents a revolution in the industry, an expansion of coffees flavor possibilities, and a major turning point for farmers, roasters, and baristas. A bright, beautiful coffee to enjoy daily, the Jaramillo Geisha is the stuff of legends.

Why you'll love it: One of our more darkly roasted single-origin coffees, this natural-processed Brazilian has the sweetness and nuttiness of a chocolate-caramel candy bar.
Story of the bean: In the 1940s, coffee consumption was beginning to soar and Brazilian coffee producers struggled to find a coffee tree that could withstand the strong winds and rain in the tropical savannas south of the Amazon. The solution was a hybrid plant called Catuai, a highly productive dwarf variety prized for its sweetness. With rich chocolate flavor and a full body, the Blue Diamond is a shining example of a Brazilian Catuai.

Why you'll love it: Not only does this coffee taste delicious and refreshing when brewed hot or cold, it also represents a commitment to support and nurture the Haitian coffee industry.
Story of the bean: Farmers from the highest mountains of Southeastern Haiti overlooking the Caribbean grow coffee the way it has been done for two-hundred years - on small, family-owned farms alongside a diverse mix of shade trees, banana plants, and ground crops. Women cheerfully process and sort the coffee and load up the best grades for export on the colorful Tap Tap trucks to be delivered to the shipyards of Port Au Prince.
The resulting elegant, velvety-smooth coffee is a perfect example of what we mean by a culinary coffee and stands as a testimony to the abiding smallholder Haitian farmers with whom we are excited to have this historic partnership.
Take a look at our Scrapbook for more information about our efforts in Haiti.

Why You'll Love it:Kenyan coffees are prized for their intense citrus notes, and this lot is the best we've tasted this year.
Story of the bean:The Murathe family has managed the small Ibutiti coffee estate, 40 miles north of Nairobi, since 1985. The family has taken the more labor-intensive approach of milling and drying their own beans in order to have more control over the quality and taste of the coffee. Workers on the farm are paid nearly twice the going rate for labor in this rural area, and pick only the ripest cherries. That extra effort is worth it - this coffee was sold at a premium at auction due to it's outstanding taste and sweet, citrusy profile.

Why youll love it:The effects of high altitudes give this coffee flowery notes of rose and honeysuckle that arerarely seen in a Mexican coffee.
 Story of the bean:Grown on the western slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur mountain range, this lot was provided by the members of the SICOBI cooperative. These heirloom typica plants take on intense floral aromas due to the high altitudes and cold evening temperatures they endure. Colder nights cause the plant to naturally send more sugar to it's cherries in order to protect the seeds, resulting in a more intensely sweet and floral cup of coffee.The cooperative where this coffee comes from has over 200 producing members, and was founded by a group of biologists called GAIA, an NGO working to preserve biodiversity in the Sierra Madre del Sur. Each year, cooperative members in the surrounding communities take more and more control over the business, increasing the quality of the coffee. We are looking forward to many more seasons of exceptional coffee from this cooperative and from this region of Mexico.

Why You'll Love it:Made with a coffee variety descended from the Jamaican Blue Mountains, this brew delivers an unmatched, refined sweetness.
Story of the bean:In the 1920s, seeds from the famed Blue Mountain region of Jamaica were the first coffee to ever be planted in Papua New Guinea. These days, the coffee plants are thriving in the high altitudes near the Waghi Valley. Sweet and distinctive in taste, with notes of grape and cedar, this Kunjin coffee stays true to its excellent lineage.

Win Butler and La Colombe Coffee have partnered to offer a limited presale ofRaRa Coffee, a specialty coffee grown in Haitiandroasted in Philadelphia.
The RaRa coffee was created to support health and agriculture initiatives in Haiti. Proceeds from the sale of this coffee will go to support Partners in Health and Haiti Coffee Academy efforts.
Being in the mountains of Haiti, it is hard not to think about coffee. The elevation, the sunshine, the soil, and incredible people, who have been growing the plant on tiny family plots for centuries. Haiti is buzzing with potential and possibility, and coffee can be an important part of its rebirth!
I'd heard about what La Colombe was doing with their coffee academy so I approached them to see if they'd make this coffee for me, because coffee is so important to Haiti, and Haiti is so important to me and everyone in the band.
Really happy to share this with you, especially with all the funds going to Partners in Health, The Coffee Academy and Haiti.

Why You'll Love it:This complex coffee from the Indonesian island of Sumatra was processed with a unique method that produces beautiful, aromatic notes of fruits and herbs.
Story of the bean:In the Northern regions of Sumatra, small land-holders use an unorthodox coffee processing method called "Giling Basah." Thisfruit-removalprocess is unique to Indonesia because although the altitude and soil of Sumatra can produce outstanding coffees, the humid air and constant rains make it difficult to dry the coffee slowly as is done in much of the rest of the world. Giling Basah or"wet hulling" is responsible for the complexly sweet flavors in this coffee. These beans were wet-hulled and dried in the sun, resulting in a lightly tart, syrupy brew with notes of pear and juniper.

We have very excited news to share with you. Today October 12 2015 we have kicked open doors to their brand new state-of-the-art cafe and headquarters complex. Located on 4th Avenue and Cherry Street, just blocks from the heart of downtown Olympia, this cafe gleams with custom flourishes, bells and whistles, and details to drive a coffee nerd to rapture, merging Pacific Northwest interior design with a mid-century modern aesthetic sensibility.
The gear list at Olys new space includes a La Marzocco Strada EE espresso machine (customized by Espresso Parts), a Poursteady brewer, grinders by Baratza, Mahlkonig, and Nouva Simonelli, plus two roasters: an Ideal Rapid Gothot 23kg and Diedrich IR-12. Guests in the space can glimpse nearly every step of the Olympia Coffee Roasting Co. process, from cupping to sample roasting, production to packaging, plus floor to ceiling green coffee storage.
The Roussa Cassel designed space was built by Bicycle Homebuilding, featuring custom cabinetry and furniture by Michael Hedgesand sustainable wood by Windfall Lumber. Additional design elements were provided by the teams at Garza Marfa and Moonish.
Opening day for the space is October 12th, 2015, and the shop will offer a public cupping program every Friday at 10am at the spaces purpose-built cupping lab. OCR co-owner Oliver Stormshak has promised nitro coffee floats plus affogatos on the menu, made with Olys Sweetheart Espresso blend. Ilove the views into the operation from the customer seating area and the street, Stormshak, so you can cleanly see the Gothot and the Diedrich (soon to be moved) crushing out perfect roasts, sample roasting, and cupping all from your seat. For a coffee geek its a thing of beauty.
Exciting new coffee destinations are de rigeur in bigger Pacific Northwest cities like Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver, BC, but here in plucky little Olympia, this is about as big as it gets for a new coffee space. Stormshak promises an elevated cafe-retail experience on par with what cafe goers might find in L.A. or New York. We want to help restore pride in Olympia, WA by leading the way and help spur an economic revitalization in our downtown,.
A noble goal, powered one nitro cold brew float at a time.

Our Ethiopia Biloya Organic receives the highest score of 95 points. In the Everyday Exceptional: Macro Lots of 2015.
Origin: Gedeo Zone, Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia.
Delicate but extraordinarily intricate. Passion flower, orange, loquat, sandalwood, frankincense in aroma and cup. Sweetly bright, juicy acidity; light, silky mouthfeel. Flavor resonates far into a long finish with very little loss of complexity.
This coffee is certified organically grown and Fair Trade certified, meaning it was purchased from small-holding farmers at a fair or economically sustainable price. Yirgacheffe coffees like this one processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying) typically express great aromatic complexity and intensity, often with a particular emphasis on floral and citrus notes. The Biloya Cooperative was established in 1976, and in 2002 joined twenty-plus other primary cooperatives located in the Gedeo Zone of Southern Ethiopia to form the Yirgacheffe Farmers Union. Olympia Coffee Roasting is a small-batch wholesale and retail roasting company with a youthful, no-nonsense style and a commitment to high-quality organic coffees.

Who Should Drink It: Those who enjoy being seduced and dazzled.

Recently, three of our team had the immense honor of representing Olympia Coffee Roasting and the Pacific Northwest overall at the United States Coffee Championships in Long Beach, California. Co-owner Sam Schroeder, Retail Trainer Brady MacDonald, and Downtown Coffee Bar Manager Alex Choppinqualified for this prestigious eventby competing at the regional levelin October. There, Alex placed Second in Brewer's Cup, Brady placed Second in Barista Championship, and Sam was crowned Northwest Barista Champion.
At the U.S. Coffee ChampionshipsSam, Brady, and Alex all had strong showings in the semi-finals round of each competition. Brady's routine focused on ingredients from the Puget Sound communitycoming together with coffee made by a community in San Sebastian de la Plata in Huila, Colombia, with whom we've been proud partners for years. It was a beautiful and thoughtful exploration of his progressive ideas about food, community, and coffee. Unfortunately, his routine went over by just two seconds, disqualifying him from the finals round. You can look forward to enjoying this coffee later this year.

Alex, in Brewer's Cup, presented a theory on clarity and how it can be providedat several levels in order to create a better experience for customers. He brewed coffee using the same equipment we use at our Downtown and Capitol Boulevard Coffee Bars. Alex made finals for Brewer's Cup as a result.
Alex brews with the Kalita to take 5th in place in the United States Brewer's Cup
Sam's Barista Championship routine focused on three communities: the Ademegorbota cooperative in Ethiopia, our roasting team in Olympia, and the cafe community as represented by the relationship between the barista and consumer. He prepared a Signature Beverage using black tea and lemon-infused drinking custard paired with Ademegorbota espresso. The result is a phenomenally tasty drink which will be available in our Downtown Coffee Bar later this year. Sam received the top score in semi-finals, advancing to the finals round.

After a long day filled with incredibly talented coffee professionals from across the country, Alex placed Fifth in the nation in Brewer's Cup. Sam placed Third in the United States Barista Championship!

All of us at Olympia Coffee are so proud of Brady, Alex, and Sam's achievements! It was an honor to have two of the baristas fromour small companyin the top six in in the nation for both the Brewer's Cup and the Barista Competition.

Founded in 2005, Olympia Coffees flagship space on 4th and Cherry originally shared the building with Espresso Parts, who vacated the space when they moved to bigger digs in nearby Lacey, Washington in 2012. Its this space that Olympia Coffee will begin occupying this spring, growing their operation from 2,000 to 6,000 square feet in the process. Plans call for a completely remodeled cafe featuring an entry and view out onto 4th Avenue, the city of Olympias main commercial thoroughfare, as well as a brand new roasting works anchored by a refurbished 23-kilo Gothot roaster from Germany; training, cupping, and QC lab facilities; increased green coffee storage; nitro and conventional cold brew bottling production; and offices for Olympia Coffees growing team.
Speaking with Sprudge by phone, Olympia Coffee owner Oliver Stormshak says they plan for the newcafe to be a show stopper and mentioned that it will feature an expanded menu, along with plans for select cold brew offerings and nitro cold brew kegs for wholesale partners. The architect behind Olympia Coffees expansion is Roussa Cassel, with materials sourced from Windfall Lumber, a leading purveyor for reclaimed lumber in the Pacific Northwest. Construction will be managed by Bicycle Homebuilding Company.

This year's holiday blend is approachable in flavor, rich in complexity, and perfectly balanced. Three very different coffees are combined to achieve a drink that pairs well with a cool morning or a holiday dessert table The heart of the blend is a combination of micro lots purchased during the Capucas Cooperative Competition earlier this year. These award-winning lots are put together as Capucas Reserva and represent our sweetest and best tasting Honduran lots. Flavors of blackberry and caramel are derived from Kenya Kiunyu. The name Kiunyu is from a stellar washing station in the Karinyaga region of Kenya. Lastly, a natural processed coffee from the Banko Cooperative in Yirgacheffe Ethiopia adds spice and more berry fruit to this winter-friendly mix Happy Holidays from Olympia Coffee Roasting Co.

Over the years Olympia Coffee has shown a great presence in both our regional Barista and Brewer's Competitions as well as the national-level US Barista Competition. We've had the honor of bringing home 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th Place in the NW Brewer's Cup all in the same year, 2nd Place US Brewer's Cup, Finals-Round at the US Barista Competition and even 1st and 2nd Place NW Brewer's Cup earlier this year during the 2014 season. The 2015 Competition Season kicked off this weekend though in Rancho Mirage California and Olympia Coffee showed up in full force.   We are proud to have our first everBarista Competitionpodium positions, and the topTWOat that.Brady Macdonald, our Retail Trainer here in Olympia, brought home 2nd Place andSam Schroeder, one of Olympia Coffee's owners as well as our Retail Director, came away with the First Place Barista Competition win! These guys both get an automatic position in the US Barista Competition Semi-Finals Round in February.   Further,Second Placein Brewer's Cup this year went for the second year in a row, to our Downtown Olympia Store Manager,Alex Choppin, andFirst Placewent to our wholesale partners atMorsel Seattlethrough the knowledge and skills ofAkaash Saini. We are so proud to share these wins with these guys!   If you'd like to try the winning coffees, bothSam and Alex were using ourEthiopia Konga Yirgacheffe Organic, and Brady was using ourHonduras COCAFELOL Reserva Organic. We believe it's important to note that all three of our trophies were earned withCertified Organiccoffees.   To watch re-plays of any of these competitions check out theUS Coffee Competitionssite, and stay tuned to our social media for a chance to try the award winning drinks soon.

Without the love, its just coffee.
PTs Coffee Roasting Co. began in 1993 as a single coffee shop in Topeka, Kansas. An intense passion for coffee led us to start roasting in 1997. Now, over 20 years later, we are still a group of explorers committed to sourcing, roasting, and drinking the best coffees in the world.
Nearly 80% of the coffee we produce is acquired through our Direct Trade program. The farmers who grow our coffee are not just suppliers, they are our friends and partners. Exceptional coffee is born from great partnerships and our partners are selected for more than their harvests  they are socially responsible and environmentally conscious.
Currently we roast dozens of single-origin specialty coffees and signature blends for our retail locations, wholesale clients, and online customers around the world. We have been recognized as Roaster of the Year by Roast Magazine and we are among the leading roasters reviewed by the premier industry resource, Coffee Review, with over 20 scores of 94 and above.
PTs Coffee can be found in fine coffee shops, restaurants, and select grocery stores nationwide.

Is it possible to be significantly different, but still have the comforting familiarity of being the same?Consider the story of PTs Coffee  similar to others in the coffee industry, but then again, not. Our journey continues to both guide and motivate us to succeed every single day in Topeka, Kansas  where were based  an unlikely location for a specialty coffee roaster.
When I came to Topeka in 1991, I combed the town in search of a better than average cup of coffee only to eventually admit such a thing did not exist. I was working as a professional photographer for a daily newspaper with a reputation for launching careers of young, energetic photographers, and I desperately needed a great cup of coffeeto wake me up in the morning and to fuel my passion for my craft.
One Saturday, as I sat on the couch watching a baseball game, my yearning for a better cup of coffee was interrupted by a life-altering idea: if no one else would offer an amazing cup of coffee, why couldnt I?
But wait  I was living in a cheap downtown apartment where I harbored my dreams of climbing mountains in exotic locations to take photos for National Geographic. I had no intention of switching careers, but soon began formulating what seemed like a simple plan. I would open a small coffee shop.
My roommate at the time, Fred Polzin, worked as manager for a national sandwich chain, so he could be my business partner and run the place, and I would help out whenever possible. It seemed like a plan to me.
After a bit of gentle persuasion, education and good old fashioned arm twisting, I convinced Fred to join me on this adventure to open a coffee shop in Topeka. Our goal was to make great coffee, plain and simple  nothing more, nothing less. Thats pretty much where our dream ended.
We searched for locations but soon had to admit we were hampered by limited resources and a glaring lack of business experience. Potential landlords gave us every excuse imaginable not to rent to us, the most outlandish being I dont want the smell of coffee in my building. Downtown Topeka offered interesting sites, but we didnt have the resources for the remodeling that would be required. It soon appeared we had struck out and were done before we even started.
Thankfully, defeat was not in the stars. A local restaurateur with a failing bar and grill contacted us to see if we wanted to rent the overflow area of his business. He convinced us it could work and more importantly, it fit our budget of nothing since we hadnt a cent to spend. We were, however, rich in ideas, so we borrowed $6,000 from a local bank and another $6,000 from family and friends. We promised our family and friends a 20% interest rate, repaid in full within one year. It was a promise we kept.
On February 3, 1993, we opened PTs Caffe Espresso. Our little caf consisted of only an espresso machine and a few second hand tables and chairs. Taking turns working shifts and learning our craft, our store was overflowing with business within six months. We were, in our own eyes, successful.
We were, and still are, an odd team as business partners, but thats the beauty of the partnership and the friendship.
As business in our first store boomed, we made plans for a second store  one we would do on our terms at a better location, with a better design and with the right equipment. The doors to the second store opened in 1994. Business slowly gained steam and all signs were positive. Our goal wasnt to get rich, or open a national chain; we simply wanted to offer great coffee and hopefully make a little money for ourselves.Now was the time to pause and reflect on our accomplishments, and we started by sampling our product.
I wasnt pleased. It wasnt good. How could we have missed such a crucial step in our process? We switched roasters, learned how to brew a better cup, then switched roasters again. Nothing, however, seemed to work. We were forced to admit our coffee was only average. Equally distressing was the fact that I couldnt describe to Fred, or anyone, what I was trying to find in a cup of coffee. For me, explanation was impossible. I remember telling Fred I would just know it when I found it. Id tasted it before and I knew we would find it.
Switching roasters hadnt been the answer as the freshness of the product seemed to be problem.Roasting our own coffee was the only solution.
It took us two years to save the money, but in 1997 we bought our first roaster and inventory of green coffee. This would surely make all the difference in the world. Now I could finally return to focus on my photography career because there would finally be great coffee in Topeka.
Instead, I spent the next two years fascinated and intrigued by the coffee I was roasting. Exploring and educating myself on what was required to roast great coffee had made me passionate about the process. Once again we tried our coffee as if we were tasting it for the first time and compared our brew to what was offered by other local and national competitors. I know this sounds crazy, but it still wasnt good enough. Not that it was bad, it was every bit as good as the other roasters. But it wasnt spectacular in sweetness or balance. Not yet; we still didnt have the answer. Thats when I realized I needed to learn a lot more, ask more questions, and seek better answers.
By this time, my passion for the coffee industry had driven my photography career into the background. I knew it was time to focus, so I quit my job at the newspaper and became a full-time employee of PTs Coffee. However, I still wasnt able roast and brew what I longed for  an amazing cup of coffee. I was stumped at the time.
I found the answer in 2001 while touring the coffee producing regions of Guatemala on a junket with the Specialty Coffee Association of America. In fact, the overly simple answer hit me like a ton of bricks: The coffee we got out of our roaster would never be any better than the coffee we put in our roaster.
I had to buy better coffee.
It was plain and simple. Its what guides our judgments to this day. Is the coffee the best it can be? In the bigger picture, what we learned was more about ourselves than about the coffee business. We confirmed to ourselves it was more important to both of us to succeed on our terms, not someone elses. This was a labor of love, not money. We simply loved coffee, loved the people and loved the process of finding, roasting and brewing phenomenal espresso and drip coffee.
We could have sold our small business many times and retired or launched another career that would have probably made us more money. But thats not what were about. We are here to make great coffee and help our friends do the same. What we learned along the way about our business is that if we focus on superior quality and succeed at making great coffee, our business thrives as well.
We warmly invite you to join us on this journey.

Jeff Taylor, co-founder, CEO and Director of Coffee Operations for PTs Coffee Roasting Co., founded PTs Coffee in 1993.
Prior to creating PTs with business partner Fred Polzin, Jeff was an award-winning photojournalist for several newspapers and wire services, including the Topeka Capital Journal.
He has been published in many national publications, including Sports Illustrated, The New York Times, USA Today, ESPN The Magazine, Associated Press and REUTERS News Service.
Jeff earned a number of awards from the Associated Press, Inland Press, and the National Press Photographers Association, including Region 9 Photographer of the Year in 1990 before retiring from Photojournalism in 2004 to pursue coffee passions full-time.
Jeff worked with many others to develop, what eventually became the United States Barista Competition dating back to 1999. In that year a member of PTs staff placed second in the little known Torani Barista Competition. As a member of the founding committee for the United States Barista Competition, Jeff traveled around the world judging the USBC, Mexican National Barista Competition and the World Barista Competition in the competitions formative years. But after several years of voluntary service, he returned to focus on buying coffee for PTs and began the work of developing PTs Coffee Roasting Co.s Direct Trade Program.
After his work with the competition Jeff was nominated, and subsequently accepted, a position on the Specialty Coffee Association of Americas Board of Directors, serving one term.
While serving on the board for the SCAA, Jeff made the transition to Coffee Buyer for PTs Coffee and began the process of building relationships with producers around the world, specifically with the best producers in each country. To this day, Jeff travels to meet with our coffee-producing partners in Central & South America and Africa, to experiment, source and evaluate the harvests from each farm, and develop a strategy of partnering on social projects. This direct relationship with the producer guarantees that the price paid for the coffee goes straight to the farmer and not through a third-party middleman.
Fred Polzin, co-founder of PTs Coffee Roasting Co., was born in Hoisington, Kansas, in 1963. Fred grew up in Emporia where he graduated from Emporia High School in 1981. He attended both Emporia State University and Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas, majoring in Communications and Political Science.
Fred and Jeff decided to open their first coffeehouse in 1993.
Prior to that, Fred had managed a number of fast food restaurants including Burger King and Schlotzskys, giving the partnership the experience it needed on the retail level to succeed.
As the small coffee house business began to take off, Fred left his full-time job with Schlotzskys Corp., to pursue this new venture. PTs began roasting its own coffee for restaurants and coffee houses throughout northeast Kansas. Soon, the business expanded and additional coffeehouses were added.
In 1999, Fred led the charge to form PTs Coffee, a wholesale company and supplier of micro-roasted coffee in the Midwest. There is one retail location and well over 200 wholesale accounts across the country.
Maritza Taylor has been in the coffee industry since 1999. She began her career as a quality control analyst for the Colombian Coffee Federation (FNC) in Bogota, Colombia, serving in this capacity for five years.
She accepted a position with Neumann Coffee Group in Bogota, in 2003 to work with Quality Assurance for Specialty Coffee. Neumann Coffee Group has 46 companies in 28 countries offering green coffee services all over the world.
As part of her responsibility, Maritza was one of the first four coffee professionals in Colombia certified by the Quality Coffee Institute as a Q-Grader. Shortly thereafter, she became one of only seven Certified Instructors of the Q-Grader Program in Colombia.
Maritza is now the Director of Quality Control for PTs Coffee Roasting Co., based in Topeka, Kansas. She works to ensure all of our Direct Trade partners are meeting, or surpassing, our quality standards and continually building relationships with producers.

His practical knowledge of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, climate and soil analysis, and biogeography provide us with an impressive opportunity to embolden our working relationships with our Direct Trade partners. Here at our roasting facility, this skill set also applies to Brents initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint, institute everyday green practices, and develop partnerships with local farmers involving composting of production by-products.

Coffee is a beverage bringing together communities from all over the world. There is more to coffee than just knowing how to brew it. To truly understand the origin of where that coffee comes from and how much it took to get that coffee in our hands, only then do you unlock and appreciate what it has to offer.  Phil Hall
Ozzie Mendoza is an Alabama transplant that came to work at PTs Coffee Roasting Co. with a purpose. As a college student, he spent a summer abroad in Tuscany, falling in love with Northern Italian-style espresso and the culture around it. When he returned to Alabama, he found a coffeehouse that served PTs La Bella Vita Espresso, and fell in love with its quality. On a trip to Topeka, he had the opportunity to meet and talk with PTs owner, Jeff Taylor. That conversation found a shared excitement and philosophy about coffee and travel, and he knew that PTs was where he wanted to be.
As soon as he graduated, Ozzie moved to Topeka and quickly became a strong member of the barista team during the first year of PTs new Third Wave-style cafe, PTs at College Hill. He represented PTs as a team competitor in PTs inaugural Flatlanders Barista Cupand volunteered hours at the 2012 Big Central Regional Barista Championship. When he wasnt working at the cafe, he was assisting Maritza in the Quality Control lab as an assistant and second cupper. In this position, he developed his palate and immersed himself with knowledge directly from the Roasting Team.
Ozzie is currently part of the Customer Service and Sales Team and enjoys the opportunity it gives him to meet and share his knowledge with our wholesale and internet customers.

Austin, a long time resident of Kansas Citys Missouri and Kansas, began his career at PTs, part time in 2014s summer. It didnt take long for him to fall in love with his coworkers, shop, customers, and neighborhood as well as the craft of extracting excellent coffee. He counts himself privileged to represent PTs presence in his favorite city.
Austin has always had an itch for two things: people and adventure. His hobbies and interests are as spread apart and sporadic as the Midwest weather. A rock climbing, backpacking, movie-going, reading enthusiast, Austin can be found eating BBQ or sushi, enjoying folk or hip-hop, discussing theology or philosophy, and loving his Saint Bernard Boone and wife, Kaytlyn. He is currently building a tiny house and believes:
We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical aids, but by an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not forsake us even in our soundest sleep. I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor. It is something to be able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do. To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts.

Nick has been a part of the PTs family since April of 2015. His love for coffee began when he was a barista at acaf inside alarge bookstore chain. He soon realized there was much more to coffee than what he had previously experienced. Nicks curiosity quickly turned into the desire to understand specialty coffee, thus leading Nick to join the crew at PTs.
As the Director of Catering, hes the guy to talk to if you need exceptional coffee and smiling faces at your event. Outside of the coffee world Nick likes to read books and poetry so that he can interpret them in hilariously terrible ways. He also likes to spend time with his dog, working and riding on his motorcycle, and entertaining his friends with terrible, terrible coffee puns.
Leah most enjoys exploring life with others: to her its about being and sharing. Life is better shared.
After a brief stint working as both a barista and part of the PTs production team, Leah currently answers customer service questions and assists in getting orders out the door into your eager hands. Before working at PTs in Customer Education and Support, Leah worked with a non-profit organization off the coast of Northern California. She is a Kansas native turnedworld explorer. If you dont find her drinking coffee, youll probably find her exploring a new city or country, backpacking, biking, running or doing anything outdoors while making new friends along the way. She is always planning her next adventure while making sure she is surrounded by great people and great coffee.
Coffee has been a part of Corbins life for nearly a decade. The tasty brown elixir kept him fueled as he pursued a degree in Fine Arts from Washburn University and he paid for his habit by scrubbing toilets for a local law office. Corbin officially joined the PTs family as our delivery driver in the summer of 2015. You can spot his beautiful hair as he weaves through traffic distributing pounds of beans in the Topeka, Lawrence, and Kansas City areas.
In his free time, youll likely catch Corbin doing deep, deep nerd stuff like playing D&D and board games, sketching and painting, or working on plans to launch his rap career.

PTs Coffee Roasting Co. is committed to working with coffee farmers who are true artisans of coffee cultivation and practice their craft with dedication, skill, and passion. We work with, and offer our support to, these skilled artisan farmers for the sole purpose of presenting our customers only the highest-quality coffee.
We believethere are a number of critical factors contributing to the growth of a truly exceptional coffee, and that farmers are one of the key factors. Therefore we believe those who do great work should get a great price; we do not believe in coffee subsidies.
Working withproducers to deliver the highest-quality coffee for our customers requires that we listen and give feedback in their creation.
We believethat an artisan coffee farmer who grows an award-winning coffee should be given all the credit. Recognition develops dedication to craftsmanship, skill for production and passion for the harvest quality.
We knowthat great coffee can be produced through sustainable methods. We only work with farmers who think long and hard about economic, social, and environmental conditions of their farms and their communities. Sustainable does not have to mean organic, but it certainly could.
We seekto deliver the highest possible return to farmers and require our importers, exporters, cooperatives and farmers to agree upon the financial distribution prior to harvest and act transparently in the execution of distribution, allowing us to monitor the committed delivery price to the farmers.
We believeour goals are more effectively achieved when the number of individuals or organizations between the coffee farmer and PTs Coffee Roasting Co. are minimized to allow for better communication. Through our Direct Trade Coffee program we feel we can achieve an excellent quality coffee and promote a sustainable coffee crop.

Artist Series2
Artist Series 2 by Skye T. Steen
The winner of our second run of submissions to the PTs Artist Series is Skye T. Steen!
Skye, who lives in Durban, South Africa found out about our contest through Twitter and sent in her winning design with the description, A hare  elegantly sipping on a cup of coffee. A rabbit is seen as an alert, swift animal, so using him is a way to glorify coffee and give it credit.
Having recently graduated, she works at The Fire Tree Design Company in South Africa as well as doing freelance design and illustration work. Her interests are multiple and varied, but always with an artistic and creative bent. She is active in many local creative events and spends her time painting, sketching, playing music, and attending local shows. She says her future is wide open and that she could end up anywhere having fun and enjoying what I do.
You can check out her online portfolio here.

Artist Series1
Artist Series  1 by Holly Bastin
Mug by Holly Bastin
Holly Bastins journey through the coffee world started as much out of curiosity as anything else. Throughout her years working for PTs, she was given the opportunity to learn the skills of a great barista, and to participate in several events that furthered her understanding of espresso preparation. She placed 2nd in the first annual SCAA Midwest Regional Barista Competition, and went on to compete two more times in the regional competition, as well as participating on the national level. Every time she competed, she found that there was always room for growth and learning in her craft. Before semi-retiring from the coffee world, she acted as SCAA Judge, Trainer, and committee member, and was published multiple times in Barista Magazine.
Outside of the coffee world, Holly is a tremendous artist and we are so happy to feature her as our inaugural artist in the new PTs Artist Series.

The holidays are rapidly approaching and we have a few shipping updates to pass on to you so you can enjoy great coffee during the festive season. Thanksgiving is a time to feast, enjoy the gift of family, and give thanks for all that we are grateful for. We are thankful for the time and effort poured into each and every harvest and the farmers who dedicate their lives to producing great coffee year after year. We are thankful for the baristas, roasters, staff, and the families who make what we do possible!Most of all, we are thankful for you, our customers and friends who have followed and supported us through the years.
Unfortunately, Thursday holidays are not ideal for shipping, and if you want to share great coffee with your family without expediting your order, you may want to check our transit times to ensure its arrival before the holiday.
If you are located in a four day transit zone, your coffee will need to ship on Friday, Nov. 20th, in order to arrive before Thanksgiving. If you select our Flat Rate, we will choose the best option for you to get it there on time. FedEx Express also offers extremely competitive rates, and if you order a little late choosing the 2-Day or Overnight option will not cost you an arm and a leg!
PTs Coffee Roasting Co. will be closed on Thursday and Friday in observance of Thanksgiving. Orders placed after 8 AM on Wednesday the 25th will roast and ship on Monday, Nov. 30th.
If you would like to order any of our special coffee offerings for Thanksgiving, we will be having a special holiday roast on Monday, Nov. 23rd:, Estate Series  Finca Kilimanjaro, Auromar Geisha Natural Peaberry, PTs Reserve Geisha Blend.
To ensure that you do not run out of coffee, we strongly encourage you to order 50% more coffee than you are expected to need in order to make up for any unexpected weather/holiday delays. If you are unsure of your ship range, please refer our Shipping FAQ. You can place your orders online, by emailing orders@ptscoffee.com, or by calling 785.862.5282.

We have a winner! The firstPTs Challengewent down this week at our roasting facility and were proud to announce Lara Prahm as champion.
Our featured coffee this week comes from Finca El Socorro in Guatemala. OwnerJuan Diegode la Cerda goes above and beyond to consistently produce high quality coffee, andPalo Altois no exception. We couldnt wait to experiment with it given the sugary notes of marshmallow, light golden raisin sweetness, and milk chocolate finish.
Since its release in 2005, the Aeropress has grown in popularity and for good reason. The design is easy to use, easy to clean and store, and it allows you to produce a great cup of coffee quickly (typically in 90 seconds or less). The real magic of the Aeropress lies in the ability to create air pressure within the brew chamber and from being able to have all the coffee grounds fully immersed in water. These two factors combined create a cup of coffee that is smooth, rich, and typically low in acidity.
So, who should consider using an Aeropress?Are you a coffee newb? Great, its for you. As a matter of fact, this weeks champion, Lara, had never used the aeropress until about a week ago. Are you a coffee connoisseur? Cool, its for you as well. Love to travel, camp, or adventure, all while being able to make great coffee? Yup, this ones for you too.Thats the best part: no matter what your level of coffee expertise or dedication, the Aeropress is likely a good fit for you.

The holidays are rapidly approaching and we have a few shipping updates to pass on to you so you can enjoy great coffee during the festive season. Thanksgiving is a time to feast, enjoy the gift of family, and give thanks for all that we are grateful for. We are thankful for the time and effort poured into each and every harvest and the farmers who dedicate their lives to producing great coffee year after year. We are thankful for the baristas, roasters, staff, and the families who make what we do possible!Most of all, we are thankful for you, our customers and friends who have followed and supported us through the years.
Unfortunately, Thursday holidays are not ideal for shipping, and if you want to share great coffee with your family without expediting your order, you may want to check our transit times to ensure its arrival before the holiday.

FedEx Express also offers extremely competitive rates, and if you order a little late choosing the 2-Day or Overnight option will not cost you an arm and a leg!

Each year we have the pleasure of bringing some of the highest caliber specialty coffees through our roasting facility. We believe in the connection between the quality of any one coffee and the producers and farmers who work long hours to actualize it. Just like your favorite type of produce, quality is tied to seasonality and harvest cycles. This time of year is especially exciting with Central American harvests arriving and South American harvests expected later this fall. Our Direct Trade partners yielded exceptional coffees from these harvests and we cant wait to share them with you.
To highlight the significance of these iconic farms and what sets them apart, we present you with the 2015  2016 Estate Series. With fourunique installments, the Estate Series is split into distinct two categories: estates focusing on processing methods and estates focusing on unique varietals. Each box showcases multiple coffee offerings from one featured farm, and each distinguished farm has produced coffees that are highly acclaimed by coffee lovers around the world. Check out the list below for a sneak peak of what is to come.
This box highlights three outstanding coffees from our partners at Elida Estate featuring a Catuai varietal processed three different ways: traditional washed, honey (commonly referred to as pulped natural), and natural. The box includes three 5.5 oz bags of coffee, a brew guide with suggested home brewing parameters, and information on the different processing methods you will experience. To learn more about why we love Elida Estate and respected producer Wilford Lamastus, click here.
Pictured from right to left: Wilford Lamastus (third generation coffee producer) with his father (second generation coffee producer) at Elida Estate. The estatewas named after Wilfords grandmother, Elida.
Grown on the slopes of the Santa Ana volcano in a micro-climate similar to that of the high slopes of Kenya, the coffee included in this box is particularly exciting. This series features one coffee, Finca Kilimanjaro, processed three ways: pulped natural, natural, and one of Aidas unique washed processes known as Burundi. This box includes three 5.5 oz bags of coffee, a home brew guide, and information on the processing methods.

But in the meantime, enjoy watching our harvest unfold!
English (japanese) The smell of freshly roasted coffee came to Bellingham in 1971. From the beginning, we roasted our coffee in small batches, selecting the best beans we could find from around the world.
In the early years we roasted in our coffeehouse, a street level space in Fairhavens historic Terminal Building. We filled glass jars with freshly-roasted beans from Antigua to Yirgacheffe.
The coffeehouse brought locally-roasted coffee and espresso to Bellingham, becoming one of the cultural staples in the community. From the start, it was clear to us that coffee brings people together.
Our roasting operation has long since outgrown the coffeehouse, but we are stillproud to call Bellingham home.
Even after 40 years of roasting coffee, not a day goes by that we dont discover something new. We have a passion for learning, which is why our crew regularly participates in Roasters Guild workshops, studying topics ranging from thermodynamics to sensory triangulation. Simply put, were constantly striving to develop the best flavors possible from our coffees.
We are keenly aware of the many hands it takes to prepare a great cup of coffee. Alfredo Pacas, a third-generation Salvadoran coffee farmer, and a direct trade partner of ours, says it best: When I taste a great cup of coffee, I stop, because I know that its a miracle.
We travel every year to meet with farmers and taste improvements in cup quality. These relationships help to broaden our understanding and appreciation for all that goes into making a great cup of coffee.
We love sharing our passion for coffee. Dont hesitate to contact us to find out more about our coffees.

Our roasting operation has long since outgrown the coffeehouse, but we are stillproud to call Bellingham home.
Even after 40 years of roasting coffee, not a day goes by that we dont discover something new. We have a passion for learning, which is why our crew regularly participates in Roasters Guild workshops, studying topics ranging from thermodynamics to sensory triangulation. Simply put, were constantly striving to develop the best flavors possible from our coffees.
We are keenly aware of the many hands it takes to prepare a great cup of coffee. Alfredo Pacas, a third-generation Salvadoran coffee farmer, and a direct trade partner of ours, says it best: When I taste a great cup of coffee, I stop, because I know that its a miracle.
We travel every year to meet with farmers and taste improvements in cup quality. These relationships help to broaden our understanding and appreciation for all that goes into making a great cup of coffee.
We love sharing our passion for coffee. Dont hesitate to contact us to find out more about our coffees.

At Tonys, we believe that brewing coffee should be a simple,pleasurable and elegant part of your day. It doesnt take a whole lotto brew a great cup of coffee, just great coffee, the right brewingmethod for your tastes, attention to detail and a little love. Withthat idea in mind, we are proud to present our new brewing guidevideos.
These five new videos on our vimeo page walk you through five different brewing methods.The videos give you recipes (water-to-coffee ratios and grind sizes)for each brewing method and strip away anything complicated you mighthave heard about each one. The steps are easily repeatable at home,and when paired with a great coffee to start with (like one fromTonys, for instance), make the home coffee experience enjoyable fromthe first grind to the last bit in the cup.
Our goal with the brewing videos is the same goal we share company-wide: create something straightforward and graceful, something inviting and warm, easy to follow, yet sophisticated as well.
So go watch our brewingvideos and while you try them out, check out our other videos on our vimeo page.

The Ketiara cooperative is a women-lead cooperative. Twenty years ago, the chairwoman started to purchase cherries and process these into green coffee. At that time she sold the green coffee beans to local traders. In late 2008, she organized farmers to form a cooperative which was established in2009 with 38 members. Now, Ketiara has become one of the most recognized coffee suppliers in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra. The region is surrounded by the Gunung Leuser National Park. The cooperative consists of 897 members and covers an area of 836 hectares in total. All coffee that the cooperative produces is 100% organic and grows under natural shade. Besides growing coffee, the farmers grow staple crops and fruits. This lot is referred to as Umang Super to designate a more carefully prepped lot.
Cherries are first picked and then brought by farmers tothe processing station where they are pulped. The pulping machine releases the soft pulp from the cherries and the coffee beans pass through a screen. The beans then undergofermentation. During this stage of the process, the mucilage is released from the seed. At Ketiara they put the beans in a fermentation tank and cover these beans with water. The water is changed ever 6 hours and once the mucilage is all released, the fermentation process can be stopped. The maximum time for fermentation is 12 hours. Then, the beans are washed 3 times in the same tank and filled with water. The waste is kept separate. During the washing process, the floating beans are removed as well. Finally, the beans are dried on tarps.

Our own Director of Coffee, Andrew Bowman took home 1st prize in the Roasters Choice Competition at the Specialty Coffee Association of Americas trade show in Seattle in April.

Director of Coffee, Andrew Bowman sample roasting
After being named one of the six finalists for the competition, which took place at the 27th annul SCAA coffee exposition in Seattle this last April, our Colombia Cerro Azul was featured at the Brew Bar in the Coffee Championships arena. A panel of judges determined Andrews roast to be the best in the country. Andrew and a few other members from Tonys celebrated the win with Cerro Azul cultivars Hernando and Felipe, who made the trip from Colombia for the exposition. When asked by Daily Coffee News how it felt to win, Andrew had this to say: I feel proud that my roast did well in this competition, but I also feel excitement for the attention our success brings to the producers who put infinitely more work into it than we did. You can read his entire interview with Daily Coffee News here.
David Yake of Tonys accepts the Roasters Choice award with the cultivars of Cerro Azul.
Andrew oversees our coffee purchases and decides on the roasting profile of all our single origin coffees and blends. Join us in congratulating him for all the fine work he has done for us here at Tonys and remember that when you take that next sip of Tonys coffee, you are in good hands.

This year's Brumas del Zurqu naturally-processed Gesha leads with dense, ripe tropicalfruit followed by an understated and soft florality of roses. A shining example of wellexecutedprocessing and varietal character.
The Gesha Cultivar is considered by manycoffee professionals, connoisseurs, and enthusiasts to be the most intense, complex, brilliant cultivar ever discovered. Though Gesha gained its current acclaim from crops cultivated in Panama, its origin can be traced back to the fertile land on the slopes of southwest Ethiopia. From the birthplace of coffee, Gesha was transported across the world's foremost coffee producing countries, finally landing on the shores of Central America in the 30s. Because of its unique traits from plant to cup, Gesha has built an unparalleled name for itself, and now we have access to the greatest cultivar ever discovered grown on some of the world's greatest farms.
From consistently having multiple farms place in the Cup of Excellence, to releasingunique and rare cultivars grown in his nursery; Juan Ramon Alvarado's lore across thecoffee industry grows with each passing year.
Alvarado's micro-mill Brumas del Zurqu was built shortly after he finished as adistinguished graduate from EARTH University to help his family take hold of their ownfortune after coffee prices hit a record low.
14 years later, he is producing coffee that exceeds our expectations with respect toquality, consistency and dynamic traits. This stunning lot of Gesha from Finca Zamora hasbeen dry-processed using Alvarado's astute attention to detail and extremely technicalspecifications. Longer, controlled drying times lead to a sweeter more dynamic cup.
The fabled Gesha cultivar grown on a first place Cup of Excellence farm in Costa Ricais exactly the recipe for amazing coffee we strive to find each year.

An elegant lime-like acidity partners with a bouquet of complex fruits and spices like pomegranate & juniper to make for a truly layered and multi-dimensional profile.
In 2010, 113 of the 1600 residents of a little Kebele ("neighborhood") in Ethiopia's Oromia state called Boto banded together with the intent of producing quality coffee. On April 13, they registered themselves as a cooperative named Duromina, which translates to "improve their lives" in Affan Oromo. In the few years that have followed, the Duromina Cooperative has certainly lived up to that name.
Prior to the creation of the cooperative, farmers from Boto would bring their harvest to local markets for private traders to buy. The sales never amounted to much, as the traders would determine the price, which averaged between 1.5-3.25 birr (.07-.38 USD) per pound. Given these prices, it is no surprise that coffee benefited the farmers little, if at all.
This all changed in 2010. With the help of TechnoServe (an NPO based out of Washington, DC), the Duromina Cooperative was able to build a wet-mill, and begin producing some truly exceptional coffees. TechnoServe provided the coop with technical support and business advice, as well as connecting them with buyers who recognized the quality of their coffee, and paid much higher prices for it. Coffee from Duromina now sells for nearly five times as much as it used to. It is also expected to yield a 50% increase to each farmer's income.
The members of the coop (which now totals more than 130) understand how much quality coffee benefits them. They highly value cooperation and actively help each other. They will share their experiences with one another, trading advice and farming practices that might help their fellow farmer. This, of course, helps to improve the quality of Duromina, which in turn ensures that the coop will continue to "improve their lives."

Intense and fragrant notes of guava and passionfruit lend to a thrilling cup. El Vendaval is absolutely bursting with fresh Tropical fruits and is punctuated by a sweet caramel finish.
The Calderon Family has an amazing infrastructure of farms. They call the beautiful town of Santa Mara in Dota, Tarrazu home, and there they have built an amazing empire for themselves.
Their formidable micro mill, Los Angeles, was built early in the 2000s after making the decision to leave the famous co-op, Coopedota. This decision was made to have a firmer grasp on the processing and marketing of their many farms.
El Vendaval is one of their biggest farms. It sits high atop the peaks of Tarrazu with bursting trees of bright red Catuai. These trees are situated on very steep hillsides, which allows for amazing soil complexity and presence of sunlight for ample nutrition to the trees.
The landscape of Tarrazu is filled with many peaks and valleys in the central area of the Cordillera Talamanca. The slopes can be extremely treacherous, but the final product is well worth the trouble, as Tarrazu is widely considered one of the best places on earth to grow coffee.

Because of its unique traits from plant to cup, Gesha has built an unparalleled name for itself, and now we have access to the greatest cultivar ever discovered grown on some of the world's greatest farms.
The Lamastus family had long been known for producing exceptional Catuais when theyendeavored to plant Gesha seeds on their 1,800 MASL Elida Estate in the highlands ofPanama. After four-and-a-half years of maturation, entering their first harvest, ThatcherLamastus observed a unique feature among his Gesha trees.
The youngest leaves on the end of each branch exhibited either bronze, or green tips - agenetic pigmentation characteristic that varies by cultivar and habitat. Kindred truthseekers,Thatcher Lamastus and Verve co-founder Colby Barr separated the seeds of thetwo plants only to conclude that the green-tipped plants produced a superior cup to theirbronze-tipped equivalents. Henceforth, Elida Estate would become the first known farm toisolate and cultivate "Green Tip Gesha".
Four years later, we present the fourth vintage of a true testament to Farmlevel impact.

"A place very far away and hard to get to", as defines the word "Jurutungo," is the nameof Graciano Cruz' farm in Western Panama.
In the seventies, Jurutungo was a freshly planted farm in western Panama near the CostaRican border in a region called Piedra Candela. Jurutungo was planted with Catuai,Caturra and a modest hectare of the Gesha variety.
In 2009, Graciano Cruz took over the overgrown farm and reinvigorated the land bystumping the existing trees and allowing them to regrow. The result; the rebirth of someof the worlds oldest gesha trees on one of the highest farms in Panama.

A playful red fruit note like pomegranate sparkles while the sweetness evokes cream soda.
Maria Elena Castro's Finca Salaca had been delivering outstanding coffees to the Helsar de Zarcero micro mill in the West Valley of Costa Rica for years. Her dedication to quality and sustainability made us fall in love with her coffees from the beginning.
Three years ago her son, Luis Salazar, helped her build a mill of their own. This allowed them to process and market their own coffees, and control every aspect. Their mill, Monte Brisas, is attached to Salazar's home about a kilometer away from the farm.
Castro has long been considered one of the best farmers in all of the West Valley, and now her son is growing acclaim as one of the premier processors. His fastidious and attentive approach has created consistent processing for their coffees.
This lot is considered black-honey in its processing technique. This means that between 50-90% of its mucilage was left intact before being dried. Cloud coverage extended the duration the drying time, which resulted in more pronounced honey-process characteristics.
Finca Salaca sits at 1700 masl in the West Valley nearing the Pacific Ocean. Loaded with stunning expanses and overlooks of some of the most beautiful sights in Costa Rica, Maria Elena and her son have crafted a farm and mill with immediate quality and tons of potential for upcoming years. With the implementation of their mill, they have started using the coffee byproduct as feed and fertilizer for their family dairy and the grazing pastures, further enhancing their sustainability efforts.

Santa Clara leads with a distinct lemon acidity that is balanced by it's coconut sweetness. Such clarity and and complex sweetness make for a cleansing and refreshing cup.
Ricardo Zelaya and his family have owned and operated Finca Santa Clara for well into four generations. Not unlike most farms in Antigua, when you walk through the gates of this 25-hectare farm you see a proud display of Antiguan identity. First, a beautiful steel sign displaying the words Genuine Antigua Coffee, followed closely by bags displaying high scores from Cup of Excellence competitions past. The dry mill where Ricardo Zelaya takes Santa Clara's coffee is called Bella Vista, which is run by his cousin Luis Pedro Zelaya Zamora. The grandparents of Luis Pedro and Ricardo owned both Bella Vista and Santa Clara as well as a third farm called Carmona. These three entities were distributed to the three children, and now they are managed by Ricardo, Luis Pedro and Maria Zelaya Aguirre. These three Antiguan staples will remain forever linked by ancestral ties, as well as by the impeccable quality they all strive for. Santa Clara's estate is just off the main road in Antigua. When you enter the farm there are rows of coffee shrubs across the entire level expanse. This type of estate is very common in Antigua as there is a lot of level ground just off the main roads to have a farmhouse and cultivate large amounts of coffee at about 1500 meters. Santa Clara, however, is perfectly situated just at the base of the Agua Volcano and quickly the altitude increases as the farm progresses straight up the mountain. Ricardo Zelaya planted this lot of Bourbon at the highest section of his farm, which overlooks the beautiful Ciudad Vieja.

This year's Holiday Blend is a nod towards your favorite holiday dessert featuring dynamic candied orange acidity, bakers chocolate, mulling spice and cranberry aromatics.
Holiday Blend is an exciting outlet for us to simultaneously showcase our favorite seasonal offerings while creating a blend that we think best represents the flavors of the holiday season. This year's Holiday Blend calls upon three coffees from three unique growing regions that, together, create a dynamic bouquet of festivity and cheer.
Hailing from the San Adolfo county of Southern Huila, Colombia; "Flor del Sur," is a representation of some of the top deliveries to the Los Guacharos receiving station. Juicy and citric, Flor del Sur contributes vibrance and citrus complexity to Holiday Blend.
Responsible for Holiday Blend's sugar-browning base is a coffee from esteemed producer Manuel "Macho" Arce of Costa Rica's West Valley. With notes of bakers chocolate, carob and raisin on it's own, Arce's coffee is tasked with enforcing structure and depth this Holiday season.
At last, this year's Holiday Blend wouldn't be what it is without the complex spices and cranberry that join us from the Worka Cooperative in Southern Ethiopia's Gedeo Zone. Spiced, fruited and elegantly-floral; Worka and its fellow components create a blend that's vibrant, rich and perfectly suited to accompany any holiday occasion.

Like Thai iced tea, Kabiruini blends complex spices, black tea and a date-like sweetness.
At Verve we cup blind. To be sure we evaluate each coffee without bias or preconception, we evaluate all offers alongside others of similar origin so that only those whose quality is truly distinct advance. In the case of Kenya Kabiruini, the odds of it out-cupping its table-mates were unlikely. Kabiruini had the disadvantage of accompanying a set of samples identified as the best of harvest by their exporter. Not only did Kabiruini hold it's own against Kenya's top-scored coffees; it was unanimously awarded the second-highest score on the table. Needless to say, we're pretty excited about the unique and intense spice complexity found in this Nyeri county coffee. The family-owned farms that supply to the Kabiruini factory have, on average, half-acre plots of about 250 trees each and are members of the Mathira North Farmers Cooperative Society. Greatness is not new to Kabiruini either; The factory was awarded first place in the African Taste of Harvest Competition in 2011 by the Africa Fine Coffee Association.

Medium-bodied and nuanced, Koba is characterized by a dynamic acidity of citrus fruits and stone fruit, finished with a whisper of florality
Yabitu Koba, formed by members of the Layo Teraga last year, is a cooperative under the larger Oromia Coffee Cooperative in Southern Ethiopia.
The wet-process implemented is fairly typical for Ethiopia. Pulped, fermented, cleaned, and then dried on raised beds. This process, one of the hallmarks of great Ethiopia coffees, produces a perfectly clean coffee allowing for the delicate florals to shine through.
Uraga is located in a more arid climate than its neighbor Yirgacheffe. While arid, the area is characterized by semi-forested areas allowing for ample shade to give the trees respite from the sun. These factors, paired with the extreme altitudes known to the Uraga region are what account for Koba's vibrant and dynamic profile.

Finca La Esperanza is a structured coffee dominated by dark cherry and a cola-like complexity. A honeyed sweetness and florality add dimension to this exemplary Huehuetenango coffee.
Finca La Esperanza has been growing amazing coffees since 1956 when Heleodoro de Jess Villatoro Lpez founded the farm. The farm has since been passed through three generations and is currently under the care of his grandchildren, namely Aurelio Villatoro.
La Esperanza's routine recognition in the Cup of Excellence is testament to The Villatoro family's meticulous attention to every detail. The largest of which; choosing to start their farm in La Libertad, Huehuetenango. La Libertad's mountainous microclimate achieves the perfect balance of hot days, cool nights and a heavy dose of rain during Huehuetenango's wet season. La Esperanza is situated perfectly up a steep slope that starts at a natural spring. The spring not only provides a beautiful back-drop for the farm, but provides exceptionally pure and clean water for processing their coffee.
Smaller details don't go go unnoticed either, like continuing to ferment in water and maintaining a steady and quick processing schedule even during the busiest times of harvest. Their mill is on premises and is used for the family's multiple farms.

Bright and fresh like Strawberry puree, this natural Limu Seka has the rustic sweetness of brown sugar with a spiced complexity.
In Western Ethiopia, Mohammed Lalo's Fahem Coffee Plantation sits in the Limu Seka district within the Oromia region. The 200 hectares that are the Fahem Plantation sit amidst natural forest inhabited by the indigenous people of the Oromo ethnic group. In addition to managing his plantation with maximum care to ensure the natural ecosystem remains intact, Lalo is in the process of designing an out-growers program to work with local indigenous farmers who collect coffee available naturally in surrounding forests. Grown under the fifteen species of shade tree that also inhabit the Fahem Coffee Plantation, coffee cherries are picked only when they've reached maximum ripeness. Within four hours of picking, coffee cherries are spread evenly on raised drying beds to guarantee maximum uniformity in fermentation.

With a crisp, red apple acidity and a caramelized sweetness; This lot of Roberto Sabillon's culminates with a velvety, cocoa powder texture.
The key to a farmer's ability to share with us the success of his produce is a transparent supply chain. He can then, and only then, understand the impact his efforts have on the value of his product. Previous to this past decade , such supply chains have been a rarity in Honduras and many farmers have historically resorted to selling their parchment to "coyotes", or middle-men, who purchase coffee at a minimum price and keep any premiums to themselves. Not to mention, in a rainforest (read: "moisture") - filled country such as Honduras, quality-related feedback and meticulous drying practices are imperative to a high quality product.
The Santa Barbara region of Honduras represents a farming region that surmounts adversity to produce some of, not only the most distinct-tasting in Central America, but the best coffees in the world. With more first-place Cup of Excellence wins than any mill in the world, Santa Barbara's own Beneficio San Vicente is responsible for much of the financing and technical support that lead farmers like Roberto Sabillon to produce gems like this year's lot from Miraflores.
With a 6th place Cup of Excellence win of his own, Roberto Sabillon fully-washes his coffee before drying on raised beds to coerce-out the vibrant and exotic flavors we've come to know and love from Santa Barbara, Honduras.

Streetlevel Espresso is quintessentially sweet with balanced notes of chewy dark chocolate and perfectly ripe stone fruits. Look for a touch of citrus as espresso and a touch more roast development as brewed coffee.
Our latest version of Streetlevel Espresso made up of two incredible fresh crop coffees from Guatemala.
Finca Candelaria is in the Alotenango region of Guatemala. In the past, coffees that came from Alotenango used to be labeled simply as Antigua because of its close proximity to the old town. Candelaria and other farms have created traction which has allowed for Alotenango to be seen as more than just Antigua's neighbor.
Our stunning lot of Candelaria was hand-selected by our green coffee team by cupping through multitudes of day lots from the estate. We chose only late-harvest lots that were filled with dense stone fruit character. These lots come from the highest portion of the farm and are made up of Bourbon and Caturra varieties.
The other component in our newest installment is a coffee called Los Santos. The coffees that make up Los Santos come from smallholder farmers in the Chimaltenango region of Central Guatemala. These farmers typically hold land between one hectare and 10 hectares. This specific region of San Jos Poaquil is fairly untapped, and most of the farmers have let their farms go wild. But, with immense potential, heirloom red and yellow bourbon trees and some guiding hands, the farmers are starting to receive premiums based on cup quality, which will quickly help the region's farmers understand its potential.

Boasting the creamy and soft acidity of cantaloupe paired with a honey and toasted grain sweetness akin to graham cracker, Sumava de Lourdes is a stellar offering hailing from Costa Rica's West Valley.
Last November, esteemed exporter Francisco Mena purchased Sumava de Lourdes in the Lourdes de Naranjo micro-region of Costa Rica's West Valley. Responsible for nearly 25% of Costa Rica's coffee production, the West Valley is characterized by slightly lower altitudes and drier climates than the neighboring Tarrazu region. All that doesn't stop the West Vallley from maintaining a formidable track record in the Cup of Excellence, year after year.
On the west hillsides of the behemoth Poas volcano, mineral-rich soil in this region is a copper hue with a powdery, clay-like composition. Tall cypress trees create a cross-hatch of windbreaks and separate the different plots where Francisco intends to cultivate varieties such as SL-28 and Villasarchi. We're excited to carry this caturra offering from Sumava de Lourdes' first year of production and look forward to continued greatness in years to come.

The 1950 Blend's flavor profile harkens back to the days of old when spice traders collided with new lands and coffee shipped on boats made of timbers, flying canvas sails. In the cup, floral jasmine, lemongrass and a dense sweetness emerge balanced with a complex and spiced, weighty body. Applying a bit more roast on the blend than we generally approach our single origin coffees with, this blend will stand up to milk with the best of them and makes an exotic shot of espresso.
Creating a blend to achieve a particular flavor profile can be very exciting. It allows us to cup samples from all over, with the goal of finding the perfect coffee, or coffees, to suit our needs. In doing so for The 1950 Blend, we seek heirloom, varietal coffees from the birthplace of coffee: Ethiopia. These coffees are some of the most nuanced, and complex coffees on the planet and can shape-shift from region to region, processing, and through roast application.

The Sermon is our fruit forward and heavy bodied espresso. A fresh, lighty tart blueberry and coffee cherry up front, with dark chocolate in the finish. These flavor characteristics blend incredibly well in milk drinks making a cappuccino with The Sermon decadent and dessert-like.
The Sermon has always been a new take on an old classic. A round body, heavy chocolate notes and berry sweetness are what we consistently strive for. We find coffees that suit this profile and create a blend that focuses on flavor, and highlights coffees from East Africa and South America. Fazenda Aurea a dry-processed Catuai from Brazil, offers a sturdy body and is a great background, while a perfect Guji dry-processed Ethiopia provides an intense berry note. Balancing out these extremes is a coffee from Colombia made up of smallholder farmers' coffees from the northern Cauca region; known for being clean, sweet and full of ripe fruit flavors. All together they yield an espresso that is both exciting and approachable.

Before finding its home in your mug, Verve coffee passes through many hands. Farmers, Roasters, and Baristas all play an integral role in crafting the cup. The Farmlevel Initiative supports every hand that holds our coffee, from seed to cup, positively impacting communities at the local and global level. By connecting farmers at Farmlevel, with you, at Streetlevel, the Initiative creates an open line of communication that transcends distance, language, and culture.

At Farmlevel, it shows farmers that their work matters, their attention to detail is noticed, and that we support them every step of the way. It supports paying our farmers premiums for quality coffees through direct trade relationships. Our direct trade practice allows us to exceed Fair Trade minimums every time, no exceptions.

You can subscribe to  17ft Ceiling Espresso.
We developed this espresso blend for our caf on Mint Plaza in downtown San Francisco. This is a pleasant, consistent espresso  enjoyable without being demanding  plump with unremarkable complexity. What is remarkable, however, is the sweet simplicity owing to the fact that we reverse-engineered a blue-collar Italian espresso blend (yes  robusta!) and substituted higher-end organic coffees. Our goal was a robust, crema-heavy, unpretentious coffee. If the Hayes Valley espresso can be like consuming a volume of In Search of Lost Time in liquid form, then the 17ft ceiling is like flipping through the New Yorker  edifying without being taxing. The baristas at the caf updose massively, set the PID two or three degrees hotter than the Hayes Valley espresso (typically 202 F on the GB5), and pull leisurely, avuncular 35 second shots, often skipping the first few drops. Served with a water back, of course.

Because it was conceived just 38.5 miles from our Oakland roastery by Aerobie (those wonderful folks who created an improbably long-flying disc), we'd like to humbly assert that the AeroPress is our first locally-produced piece of merchandise. Its a peculiar and lovely device  easily the most durable and portable option for brewing quality coffee. It produces a cup thats thick and focused, but still quite nuanced.
Comes with a set of 100 filters (and filter-holder), coffee grounds funnel, coffee scoop and stirring paddle.

Whether you are looking for an espresso grinder or a grinder to help you explore that extensive range of brew methods, the Encore is a great all around home grinder.
Over the years, the Maestro  has come to be lauded by coffee experts as THE go-to grinder for those who love both drip-coffee and manual brews. Building on that platform, Barazta has developed the Encore, with upgraded burrs to give a great grind for drip/manual brew and also fine enough for espresso. The Encore also has a completely new gearbox.

Featuring 40 individual grind settings, from fine to coarse, the Encore can please any palate with its gamut of accurate and repeatable grind settings. The Encore has an accurate medium to coarse grind for the increasingly popular manual brew methods such as pour-over, Aeropress, Siphon and Chemex. The specially designed burrs give a precise grind with minimal fines for a flavorful, balanced extraction when making espresso.

And, of course, the Encore is built with the quality Baratza parts youve come to trust. The efficient DC motor keeps your beans cool, even during extended grind times, while a combination of electric and gear speed reducers slow the burr to 450 RPM, ensuring a smooth bean feed and reducing noise, heat and static buildup.

Beyond a great coffee-drinking experience, the Encore makes for a great coffee-making experience. A convenient, front-mounted pulse button makes it easy to grind on demand into your brew basket. Whether you are looking for an espresso grinder or a grinder to help you explore that extensive range of brew methods, the Encore is a great all around home grinder.

Turn almost any Baratza grinder into a real time, weight-based grinding machine.
Make your great grinder even better with Baratzas innovative Esatto, an accessory that can turn your Baratza grinder into a real time, weight-based grinding machine. Set the weight you want and the Esatto does the rest, weighing the ground coffee within a tenth of a gram while grinding, and stopping automatically.

The Esatto is an accessory that is designed specifically for use with your Baratza Encore, Virtuoso, or Preciso.  With its easy assembly and simple operation, you will be grinding by weight in minutes. The Esatto was initially designed for use in a manual brew bar in a caf, eliminating the need to manually pre-weigh coffee beans.  The built-in precision load cell provides accurate weighting, while grinding, to within 0.1 grams. Three user-programmable buttons make for repeatable, one- touch grinding.

The Esatto is a perfect way to showcase home brewing methods and equipment. Use the Esatto plus a Baratza grinder on the manual brew bar, and show your customer that they can purchase the grinder, brew method and coffee for use at home.
Digital Control Panel: The front-mounted control panel with LED display is easy and intuitive. Three programmable buttons allow the user to program in the desired weight (+/- 0.1)  Simply press the START button, and the Esatto automatically delivers precise dosing.

Whether you are looking for an exceptional espresso grinder or a grinder to help you explore that extensive range of brew methods, the Preciso is the perfect grinder for you.
The Preciso is a beautifully designed conical burr coffee grinder that works as hard as you do to create the perfect espresso experience. It doesnt stop there of course; the Preciso has also received high marks from coffee experts as an exceptional grinder for the increasingly popular manual brew methods. The specially designed burrs give a precise grind with minimal fines for a flavorful, balanced extraction.

The Preciso is true to its name  a precision grinder with a micro-adjust system that can be dialed in like a commercial grinder. This, coupled with a coffee throughput that is 1 gram/second faster than other 40mm conical burr grinders, makes the Preciso exceptional for espresso. In addition to featuring Baratzas popular 40-grind adjustment options, the Preciso adds a second micro-adjustment level that further divides each of the 40 steps into 11 distinct settings. This means you have significantly more control over your espresso grind.

The Preciso features the quality internal parts and external elements youve come to expect from Baratza. It also comes equipped with our innovative PortaHolder, allowing you to grind your espresso hands-free, directly into the portafilter for quick setup and cleanup.

Great coffees balance sweetness, acidity and body to create the perfect cup of coffee. The Baratza Vario is a perfect example of a great grinder combining ease-of-use and a sleek appearance with a penchant for bringing out fantastic flavors in your beans.

This professional-grade grinder fits anywhere, from your kitchen to your office to your caf. While sporting a small footprint, the Vario features an impressive range of capabilities, boasting 230 distinct and repeatable grind settings from fine grind for espresso to course grind for press pot.

The design is beautiful as well as functional. Varios intuitive macro/micro adjustments make it easy to get the grind for a perfect espresso finish. Need something a little different? With a simple slide of the lever, you can switch from espresso to other coffee styles. And it couldnt be easier to get the perfect amount  digital timers and three user-programmable buttons make accurate one-touch dosing and repeatable grind times a snap.

The Varios unique 54mm ceramic flat burrs provide accurate, fast-grinding performance and remain sharp for twice as long as the best steel burrs. The high-torque DC motor and belt drive transmission mean your beans are in for a smooth, cool ride.

As always, its not just whats inside that matters; the Varios smooth operation carries over from internal to external, with front-mounted, easy-access control units, an 8 oz. grounds coffee collection bin, and Baratzas exclusive PortaHolder for hands-free grinding into an espresso machine portafilter.
Burrs: The Varios 54 mm professional ceramic flat burrs produce accurate grinding, high throughput and remain sharp for twice as long as the highest quality steel burrs. The Vario grinds 1.6 grams/second at Espresso and 2.2 grams/second at Press. The broad range of grind (230 microns to 1150 microns) and the narrow particle distribution (lack of fines) are the hallmarks of the superiority of the Vario burrs.
Digital Control Panel: The front mounted control panel with LED display is easy and intuitive. Three programmable buttons allow for grind time setting within 0.1 second (about 0.2 gram). Simply press the START button and the Vario automatically delivers precise dosing.
Grind Adjustment: The Vario offers macro and micro adjust for fine tuning with ease. The macro adjust moves from espresso to press pot in 10 distinct and repeatable settings. A secondary micro adjust arm further divides each of the 10 macro steps into 20 distinct settings. These steps enable you to dial in the exact grind for the perfect shot.
Grinds Left in Grinder: To maximize freshness, the Vario minimizes the ground coffee left in the grinder.
Brewing Methods: The Vario is exceptional for espresso and manual pour brewing methods.
Motor: A powerful, high torque DC motor effortlessly drives the burrs. This motor turns slowly resulting in cool, quiet operation and permits long grinding duty-cycles. The circuitry is equipped with an automatically resetting, thermal cutoff switch.
Calibration: The Vario is calibrated at the factory to ensure an accurate range of grind. If necessary, the Vario burrs can be easily calibrated using the special calibration tool that comes with the grinder.
Portaholder: The Vario comes with the Portaholder which permits hands-free grinding into an espresso portafilter and makes clean up a snap. The regular 8 oz. grounds bin is also included.
Cleaning: Burrs are easily removable with no tools, making cleaning very easy.
Hopper extender: An extension that can add 9 oz. of capacity to the existing 8 oz. bean hopper. Several extenders can be added to get to the capacity you need.

The Virtuoso lives up to its name by providing technical skill, classic style and a consistent, quality grind.
Grinding for espresso? Let the Virtuosos professional-grade 40mm conical burrs perform their magic for a consistent, fine grind. How about a French Press? The Virtuoso can handle that too, with a particle size uniformity that gives you consistency from cup to cup. In fact, the Virtuoso is so consistent at both the coarse and fine ends of the grind range that we consider it to be in a class all by itself  and so do many of the micro- and specialty-roasters who swear by it.

The secret to the Virtuosos consistent, smooth grind is two-fold: an efficient DC motor keeps your beans cool, even during extended grind times, while a combination of electric and gear speed reducers slow the burr to 450 RPM, ensuring a smooth bean feed and reducing noise, heat and static buildup.

The Virtuosos exterior is just as finely tuned as its interior  a convenient front-mounted pulse button allows for grinding directly into an espresso filter basket, while a 60-second timer means that its easy to replicate the ideal grind time. With the Virtuoso, the look goes beyond merely functional. A sculptured metal top and base give this grinder an expensive, elegant image that adds a sense of class and quality to kitchen counters and coffee shop workspaces alike.

When you want it all, the Virtuoso is the grinder that will get you there with function, elegance, and style.

We can send you a message when this item is available again.
Thanks! We'll notify you when this item is back in stock.
Single origins are among our most coveted coffees. Cultivated in only one region, area, or farm, they exhibit the traits of a single sourcethe soil, the elevation, the surrounding flora. Of the many single origins to choose from (and there are thousands), these are chosen by our baristas for their exquisite particularities. Elemental yet orchestrated, they offer a kaleidoscope of tasting profilesfrom citrus to caramel, nougat to bergamot. We can think of no more beautiful way to sample the nuances of place. 



Single origins are pure pleasure in the cup. Heres how we enjoy them most.
Grind
Aim for a coarseness akin to rough sea salt. Experiment with size to alter flavor.   
Prepare
Drip preparation affords pronounced clarity in the cup and highlights the single origins unique flavors. We prefer Chemex and Bonmac. 
Sample 
Try it black, at least at first, for the fullest expression of the coffeea world unfurls the moment water hits the grounds. 
Taste 
Theres no wrong sensory association. Close your eyes and see what you identify. We look for flavor profiles such as nutty, sweet, smoky, fruited, floral, chocolaty, citrus, and spice. Write them down, or simply take it all in.

The Bella is the wool sweater of our blends -- warm, comforting, familiar. Wild and citrusy organic African paired with earthy organic Indonesian makes for a vivid and fairly complex Moka/Java blend. It seems to weather the rigors of the automatic drip machine as well. This is, perhaps, why it's our most popular blend. It is also on the darker side: nice and thick without being inelegant. Bella stands up to milk or cream well, and is easily enjoyed black.

From the foggy climes of the Alta Verapaz comes a pairing of dual magnetism. Taking its influences from the rich volcanic loam of the jungle floor, the chocolate smolders with gunpowder and oolong. The coffee, meanwhile, reaches up toward the canopy of trees, with delicate florals and sunlit fruit. Clouds part, heaven and earth collide.

In Ethiopia, birthplace to coffee and home to more indigenous varietals than any other region, the production of exceptional coffee is an issue of national concern. Not only does the government-affiliated commodity exchange oversee grading and selling coffee, but most of the countrys coffee is grown by smallholder farmers. Lucky for us, weve found a peerless, naturally processed coffee from the townships of Gelena and Abaya, considered a part of the famed Yirgacheffe region. Nowadays, when many of the best Yirgacheffes are washed coffees, were pleased to find this naturalan expertly processed, bright cup.

The most coveted coffees on the planet, in a single package
THE RAREST OF THE RARE

When the elusive Gesha reemerged on the coffee scene in 2004, it caused a furor of high-stakes drama and suspense. A farmer had entered a handful of scrappy-looking beans into the prestigious Best of Panama competition. The flavor of the coffee itself was polarizingwhat was this floral, heavily fruited brew? When traced back to its source, the coffee plants themselves were just as shocking. Like Charlie Brown x-mas trees, they stood stark and twiggy amidst the verdant and prodigious crops of Panama. Out of this dizzying cloud of confusion, the farmer, Price Peterson, of Hacienda La Esmeralda, walked away with the grand prize. 

The highly coveted Gesha was recognized for what it truly was: a delicate improbability; the rarest of the rare. From that moment forward, this celebrated cultivar has shattered expectations, leaving a string of coffee love affairs in its wake. 

Originally from Ethiopia, Geshas are extremely difficult to grow and require a lot of love to achieve even a micro-lot of exquisite cherry. And theyre worth it. Impossible to refuse, and demanding unparalleled attention, they fill us with nervous, lovelorn excitement.

A blend of organic coffee that is quite dark and chocolaty. Maybe a bit more one-dimensional than the Bella Donovan, but it is a good dimension. Giant Steps is delightfully fudgy and thick in a French press or drip pot, and stands up to cream quite well. If it were any heavier-bodied, you could pour it on pancakes.

There are a lot of rumors circulating, so let's get this straight: The Gibraltar was named after the glass. Not the rock, not the strait, not the durable (if austere-looking) brand of drum kit hardware. Taller than a macchiato, shorter than a cappuccino, milk textured as a latte, temperature keyed for quaffability, the Gibraltar heralded a cultural moment in the world of coffee that we are still puzzling over. Four oz., American made, dishwasher safe. One glass per order.

The wood-neck nel drip brews a coffee that is as clean as the Chemex, but denser and more viscous. Coffee from a nel is thick, focused and incredibly sweet  texturally reminiscent of mulled wine. It's quite moody and fragile, too: Water that's too hot, a hurried pour, or even an offhand remark might wither its complexity.

Rustys Hawaiian is one part artistry, one part love story. Following a dream to live in the Kau District on the south side of Hawaiis Big Island, scientists Rusty and Lorie Obra purchased a 12-acre sugarcane farm near the Mauna Loa volcano. They soon realized that they had stumbled upon an award-winning coffee region, rich in volcanic loam and unusually high in elevation for Hawaii. Lorie, now working on her own since Rustys passing in 2006, uses only the most glistening-red, ripe coffee cherries and sorts them by hand.

On Lories left wrist is a tattoo of a lei, with Rustys name emblazoned between inked coffee leaves and cherries. Though drinking Rustys is a significantly more transitory event, this refreshing cup leaves a strong imprint of citrus and jasmine every time we brew it.

You can subscribe to  Hayes Valley Espresso.
We developed this espresso over five years ago for the launch of our Kiosk on Linden Street. This is probably our darkest espresso: lower-toned, minimal brightness, plenty of chocolate  with an engaging complexity as a straight shot. The shots are gorgeous: achingly heavy with voluptuous red-brown crema, and the silky, somewhat dangerous-looking viscosity of a power-steering stop-leak product once used on our (now departed) heroically battered 1983 Peugeot. In milk, it tastes like chocolate ovaltine, and holds its own from the daintiest 3oz Macchiato to our towering 12oz caffe latte. This is the most Brahmsian espresso we have. Brooding and autumnal, it is a coffee to mourn the passing of time.

In the Honduran village of Santa Elena, the Catracha Coffee Company helps farmers with sustainable cultivation and ensures a fair price for each harvest. Producers with limited land prioritize quality over quantity, and it shows in each cup. We are now the exclusive buyer of eight unique farmers in the community and pay an average of fifteen percent higher than ever before, all because of their superb craftsmanship. This particular coffee, Alfonso Vasquezs, is the perfect companion to the lingering wisps of summer and the arrival of fall, with its bright lime settling into the spice of ginger and clove.

The Gatubu factory, part of the Iyego Cooperative, was built in 1965 to serve the farmers in Muranga county on the slopes of the Aberdare Range, Kenya. The French Mission coffee varieties, SL28 and K7, are common in the area, and perform well in the red volcanic soils. After the ripe cherries are picked, the coffee is pulped, fermented, washed by water from the Mathioya river, and graded by hand while it sun dries. The result in the cup is bright and tangy, with grapefruit and plum acidity, and a creamy body.

Nestled between two lava flows from the Volcn Bar, Graciano Cruzs farm is a haven of sustainability. It was the first certified organic farm in Panama, and, for the past decade, Graciano has been a pioneer of resource-sparing initiatives in Peru, El Salvador, and Ethiopia. Of the highly coveted coffees that Graciano grows, this is the rarest of the rarethe unexpectedly beautiful Gesha. Spindly and unassuming as a plant, this Abyssinian native needs a lot of love (and staggering altitudes) to achieve even a micro-lot of exquisite cherry. The result is a radiantly sweet, tea-like cup, with notes of jasmine and fruit.

The Rolls Royce of pouring kettles

It's a corny locution, true, but the Takahiro 0.9 liter kettle is the Rolls Royce of pouring kettles. There is no kettle, in our opinion, that is as silky and responsive to a pour.

And the coffee was good, too. Not recommended for direct heating over a gas flame.

This coffee is generally a blend of Congolese and two different Ethiopians coffees. Together, these components produce a big, chocolaty aroma and excel in just about every prep method, save espresso and siphon.

The coffeestwo Ethiopians, one dry-processed and one wet processed; and a wet-processed Congoleseleave subtle imprints of dried blueberries and cardamom.

	While its true that the coffee is what makes Madcap so special, great art and design are just as important to tell the story of our attention to craftsmanship and detail. In 2009, Madcap approached designers Seth Herman and Chuck Anderson, two good friends and frequent collaborators, about re-envisioning the look, feel, and overall brand of Madcap from the ground up. As Seth and Chuck were already fans of Madcap's coffee, it only seemed natural to pursue the collaboration. Fast forward a few years later and the pair have helped establish Madcap as one of the speciality coffee industry's most instantly recognizable brands, from the black packaging with the woven label and pop of color to the lightning bolt to all the merchandise, photography, and design you see here on this site. Check out some of the features on Madcap's branding and design around the web on Thrillist&Behance PackagingServed.

Seth Herman (Left)

	Trevors work in coffee began in 2001 after falling in love with the culture of coffee shops while in college. That love grew after experiencing the joys of specialty coffee and resulted in years of professional growth while starting numerous cafes throughout the midwest. The fruits of all his challenges was the co-founding of Madcap Coffee Company in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 2008.

	Trevor serves as CEO with a focus on directing Madcaps retail operations. Outside of Madcap, he is serving as the current Past Chair for the Barista Guild of America, is a Specialized Instructor for the SCAA, a subject matter expert in espresso for the SCAA, an Editorial Advisor for Barista Magazine, and has been a contributor to Fresh Cup Magazine. Trevor has been competing in barista competitions since 2008, having finished in the top 6 in a regional competition consecutively for the last 7 years. In 2013 and 2014 he had consecutive 3rd place finishes in the U.S. and most recently finished 7th at the 2015 United States Barista Championship. Trevors true passion is hanging out with his wife and three daughters.

	Ryans coffee career started in 2007 when he took a part-time job working for Trevor as a barista at Moon Monkey Coffee Company in Bourbonnais, Illinois. Immediately after starting as a barista, Ryan fell in love with preparing and brewing coffee for others. His passion swelled while studying in East Africa that fall, where he found tremendous inspiration by witnessing the lives that depend on the global coffee trade. Upon completion of his Bachelors Degree, he dedicated himself to coffee full-time, learning as much as he could through blogs, books, and a lot of practice. Soon, Ryan was shown the ropes of roasting and quickly fell in love with the process. The true romance began in the summer of 2008 when he spent a few weeks roasting dozens of two pound batches, making each one different than the last, tweaking one variable at a time to explore the possibilities and discover sweetness. Later that summer, he found himself moving to Grand Rapids to co-found Madcap with Trevor. Ryan has competed in five Regional and five US Barista Competitions since 2008. Hereceivedfirst place at the North Central Regional Barista Competition in 2011 and 2012, as well as the third place in the 2011 US Barista Competition.

	Ryan is responsible for developing the green coffee buying, roasting, and barista training programs at Madcap. His favorite part of the job is seeing the story from start to finish. Ryan is a dual citizen of the Roasters Guild of America and the Barista Guild of America as well as a Lead Instructor of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. When he isn't working, Ryan enjoys mixing cocktails at home, cooking dinner with his wife, spending time outdoors, and being a self-proclaimed film critic.

	Every coffee has a story. At Madcap, it is our goal to tell that story from start to finish by highlighting the details. Before arriving in the cup, coffee travels an intricate and exacting path that, when traveled well, ensures the highest level of quality and sustainability. Every step is important, from the ripeness of coffee cherries when picked to the way the beans are milled and dried to the way it is shipped to our doorstep. Because of the delicate balance of specifics, it is imperative that we seek out direct and transparent relationships with coffee growing professionals throughout the world. Instead of simply labeling our coffee as sustainable, we have chosen to engage with the story further by exploring the uniqueness of each coffee. This way, were guaranteeing that each bag of Madcap coffee purchased was crafted with excellence. Directness and transparency are important to us. Since opening in 2008, we have been committed to buying coffee that is as closely aligned with our values as possible. All coffees on our menu can be traced directly back to the farm or cooperative where they were produced. All of our coffees have wage transparency. This is achieved by committing nearly a quarter of the year to traveling. We go to some of the most remote areas of the world to find the best coffee possible. We have personally visited 75% of the farms that produce the coffees on our current menu, but our goal is to raise that to 100% by 2014.

	Our mission at Madcap is to find fantastic tasting coffee while building partnerships of trust and transparency so that year after year we continue to grow together. We believe that high quality must be paired with deeply rooted relationships along the entire supply chain, which includes growers, exporters, importers, and even ergonomists. We only buy from farms that are as committed to the craft of farming and processing as we are in the roasting and brewing of their coffee. As partners, new goals are developed with every new growing season to continue to improve the quality of the coffee produced. Currently, three-quarters of our coffee menu is made possible by multi-year relationshipswhether they be with small farmswith a handful of these stretching back to our inception in 2008. Madcap offers 15-20 different coffees per year. To find those, we taste through thousands of coffees from across the worldsometimes even tasting hundreds of separations from a single farm or cooperativeto select a final product that we are proud to stand behind. We are confident these are coffees you will never forget.

	The idea for Madcap sprouted from friendship. After gleaning all they could from college, attempted startups, and a coffee shop in Illinois, Trevor and Ryan began sowing and cultivating their common desire: to make and share amazing coffee.

	Coffee has a tremendous story. Madcap is interested in and inspired by each detail of that story, including growing, sourcing, roasting, brewing, serving, and imbibing-- all bolstered by the relationships and culture surrounding coffee. It is our sincere hope that, when you experience Madcap, you can see, feel, and taste our commitment to highlighting every part that makes the whole. As Madcap grows, we strive to keep getting better at telling that story, so that we can share our passion with you.

	In the past five years, weve travelled North, South, East, and West across Colombia, covering as much ground as possible. At each twist and turn we were met by beautiful mountains and fresh diversity new soils, new climates, new communities of people, and, as a result, new coffee flavors. From this journey weve culled eight truly outstanding coffees to share. Each hails from a different part of Colombia, and is comprised of a handful of varieties, or even a single variety, cultivated on small plots of land by individual producers who harvest, process, and dry the coffee themselves. This is a journey of flavor, a unique representation of terroir shaped by single producing families. Thank you for joining us.

	Enrique Lopez is a top-quality coffee producer in league with a top-quality wine producer. He hand-selected the site for his Finca, Chelin, in Oaxaca, Mexico for its high elevation -- 1600 meters above sea level -- and for the cool temperatures and steady winds off the Pacific Ocean that encourage slow ripening off his coffee fruit. We met Enrique in 2013 while judging at Mexicos Cup of Excellence and visited his farm in May 2014 where we were thoroughly impressed and intrigued by variations in his processing.

	Finca Chelin was also chosen because Enrique wanted a sustainable, organic, pesticide-free farm. Currently, Fina Chelin holds 2 Organic certifications, as well as Shade Grown, Bird Friendly and Rainforest Alliance certifications -- providing ample evidence of Enriques conscientious farming practices.

	A standout as our first ever Mexican coffee, for Enriques dedication to quality, for its unique processing, and for its jammy, juicy, and clean cup profile, Finca Chelin is a coffee worth savoring.

	Coffees from Kenya, particularly the Nyeri region where the Gaturiri is from, are truly unlike any other coffees in the world. These coffees are known for their intensity of flavor packed with wild acidity, rich body, juicy sweetness and unrivaled complexity. The flavor starts with the unique SL 28 and SL 34 varieties, mutations of the Bourbon variety that are native to Kenya. Both of these varieties were created in the 1930's as 2 of many varieties by the Scott Laboratories (SL), with the hope of the variety producing high quality and having high disease resistance. Although, neither of the varieties have particularly high yields (like some Kenya varieties that have become popular over the years), they both produce outstanding flavor. The processing of Gaturiri is also noteworthy as it incorporates an extended time of fermentation with multiple stages of washing and a period of soaking at the end that assures the mucilage is fully removed prior to drying. The extensive fermentation and washing provides a clear cup and many would say this process also contributes to exotic acidity. The quality of the green coffee is finished off by arguably some of the best sorting, care, storage and shipment in the world by the exporter. The Gaturiri is true to the Kenya profile with vibrant acidity and deep juiciness in the cup, however, you will find less savory notes than what is typically expected in these coffees. Furthermore, we fell in love with this particular coffee as it also offered a really silky mouthfeel with a clean sparkling base that lingers so pleasantly throughout.

	The holiday season in Michigan always feels extra special with falling snow, glowing fireplaces, shared meals, and rich flavors. To help make the season even more memorable we've created the Holiday Fusion, a blend of some of our most exquisite coffees. A slightly exotic experience for the palette, the Holiday Fusion offers fruity notes, sparkling acidity, and smooth caramel on the finish. Pair with chocolate, mixed nuts, eggnog, or gingerbread.

	The city of Antigua, Guatemala is shadowed by several volcanos. The largest named Hunapu by the Mayans. Luis Pedro Zelaya uses the name Hunapu  meaning mountain of flowers  to refer to the coffee from producers who cultivate Bourbon, Caturra, and Catuai coffee varieties in the mixed shade and nutrient-rich soil of the volcanoes surrounding Antigua at 1500-1900 meters above sea level.

	Luis is a fourth generation coffee farmer and owner of a Beneficio Bella Vista where nearly 300 farmers deliver ripe, sorted coffee to undergoes a long, cool, fermentation and a thorough washing and drying. During this process, lots are kept separate and we have the opportunity to cup through and select our favorite small lots to piece together a custom Hunapu coffee for Madcap.

	Buyers from around the world work with Luis to select coffees delivered to Beneficio Bella Vista. It says a lot that so many roasters around the world seek these coffees, and that the 300 or so farmers involved with the Hunapu project produce quality consistently high enough to satisfy buyers. A reminder that Hunapu is a quintessential representation of the quality potential in Antigua when great varieties are paired with a nearly ideal climate and precise process, giving the coffee great structure and acidity with a syrupy, juicy sweetness.

	Over the last decades, quality coffee production in Rwanda has advanced substantially. Since being decimated by civil war and strife, coffee has become a major export in Rwanda, where more than three-quarters of its citizens subsist through agriculture. Investment in infrastructure to process coffee and close work with growers has increased production of specialty coffee, work aided by non-profit and government funded programs, some of which was advised by professionals in specialty coffee. Kanzu the Cooperative has had the support of Technoserve, an organization that was also involved in Mutovu and Yukro. It certainly helps that Rwandas terrain is very mountainous, with the high elevations, healthy ecosystems and nutrient rich soil beneficial to quality production.

	The Kanzu name refers both to the cooperative and the washing station. Kanzu rests in a valley betwixt mountain peaks near the shores of Lake Kivu. Founded in 2006 with the aid of Technoserve, Kanzu brings together the coffee from hundreds of farmers who harvest fruit from trees cultivated on the mountains above and deliver ripe cherry for processing. Old-growth bourbon trees and terroir of the Nyamasheke region provide the backbone for this coffee with powerful character and acidity, while a 24 hour fermentation process adds complexity. After harvest and drying in March-July, this coffee then faces an epically long journey from land-locked Rwanda here to the USA.

	Lush, deeply fruited, and juicy, Kanzu is vivid, clear and clean. This marks our third consecutive season purchasing coffee from the Nyamasheke region. This dynamic coffee represents the potential for high-quality in Rwanda, and elsewhere in Africa where excellent terroir can be at odds with challenges in infrastructure and government which make uncovering coffees like Kanzu difficult. Were very excited to offer this coffee for Winter and Spring.

	A taste of a Kenyan coffee can be as complex and vibrant as the systems and work that go into creating it.

	Kenyan coffee is grown by individual producers who typically cultivate a small amount of coffee, and who belong to larger groups who are organized around factories where fresh coffee fruit is delivered for processing. The producers who contribute coffee to this factory, Kathakwa, from the villages of Kibugu and Nguviu, cultivate an average of 300 trees on about an acre-and-a-half of land. Staff from Kathakwa advise on crop husbandry, the amount and timing of fertilizer application for maximum production, and when to spray for pest and disease prevention. Some farms produce passion fruit, maize, beans and tea for consumption; although producers are not encouraged to intercrop. Credit facilities, in terms of picking advances, farm inputs, school fees, and emergencies, are provided by Kathawka when funds are available.

	Rainfall in Kenya is clustered in two seasons  the main rainy season, March-October, watered this coffee, from October through December. Production at Kathawaka is focused on the lauded SL-34 & SL-28 varieties, which are associated with the Bourbon lineage, and also on Riuru-11 which is a variety developed for disease resistance and hybridized with SL28/34 varieties to improve cup characteristics. The terroir consists of the deep, rich, red soils of Mt. Kenya, at an elevation exceeding 1600 meters, which ensures consistently cool temperatures ranging from the low 50s to near 80 degrees F.

	The coffee fruit is hand-picked for ripeness and delivered same-day to the Kathakwa factory for processing where it is pulped, fermented overnight, washed, soaked, and spread on raised beds to dry. Next, the coffee is held in wooden conditioning bins for the moisture content to stabilize before it is physically graded. Water used for coffee processing is very high in N2; the waste water at Kathakwa is filtered through soak pits with nappier grass and trees planted nearby.

	After visiting Kenya, we are pleased to offer this big, bright coffee, from a sophisticated collection of people who manage their own aspect in the pursuit of quality coffee. Kathawaka displays notes of fig and plum on the low end, and bight tangerine on the high end. Cardamom and jam-like flavors create complexity in the cup. This enticing and elegant cup is loaded with qualities to enjoy.

	Las Aguas Altas, The High Waters, hails from the Huehuetenango region of Guatemala. Back for a third season, this farm is located in San Pedro Necta, an 8 hour drive from Guatemala City. We first bought from the Mendez family, the owners of Las Aguas Altas, in 2011. It was also the first year The Medez family - featuring Gabino, his younger brother Gilberto and thier nephew Francisco - directly sold coffee to a roaster. The operation is quaint and incredibly endearing. This past year we were able to deliver a bag of Las Aguas Altas to the Mendez family and it was the first time they saw their name on a bag of coffee. They were also able to drink their coffee for the first time without cream and sugar in it saying, "wow, it's not bitter!" In last years crop we are able to see the quality of cherry selection improve, which lent to an even sweeter and cleaner cup than the prior year. This past harvest, we turned our focused towards lot selection as the coffee they grow comes from 6 main areas. We dillegently tasted through all 6 of the areas and choose the 3 that were the sweetest and most vibrant to blend together this years version of the Las Aguas Altas.

	The 1st year we bought coffee from the Mendez family we inquired about a name. Gabino, the oldest brother, responded, I should probably name my farm shouldnt I? Do you have any suggestions? Our very own Production Roaster, Ben Baker-Jackson, named the farm after reminiscing about overlooking nature from the heights of coffee farms in the Huehuetenango region. This coffee produces clear richness with tart berries throughout.

	The Las Serranias is decaffeinated using the Natural Ethyl Acetate Method at the Descafecol plant in Manizales. Ethyl acetate is used as an extractor of the caffeine component of the coffee. Generally, this decaffeination process is performed using added chemicals. The ethyl acetate used in the Las Serranias, however, is obtained using fermented sugar cane (which naturally contains ethyl acetate), complementing the sweetness of the coffee. Rarely will one ever find a decaf coffee as sweet, complex, and enjoyable as the Las Serranias. Las Serranias is the exclusive decaf that is offered at Madcap as we are yet to find an option that comes close to comparing.

	Since 2010, Luis Reinosos coffee has been a star in our lineup. That year we began to purchase coffee from Luis and his brother Didier. Luis Colombian farm, Finca Vista Hermosa, or, farm with a beautiful view, rests at roughly 1800 meters above sea level, looking out on a mix of cultivated coffee and natural forest.

	Luis lives on his farm in the Herrera, Tolima Region (a 5 hours off road drive from the little town of Rio Blanco) with his wife and 2 children. He's a first generation farmer excited about growing great quality and partnering with a roaster to build a sustainable business. Full of lush fruit flavor, a clean and silky mouthfeel, and bright pleasing acidity, this is a world-class coffee. We at Madcap are delighted to be the only suppliers of Luis Reinoso coffee in the world!

	The 2015 Good Food Award Winning Reko is back for its second season!

	Ethiopia is known for luscious coffee  and nowhere more than Yirgacheffe. Kochere, a micro-climate within Yirgacheffe, benefits coffee with an iron-rich red-brown soil, abundant rainfall, elevation from 1850-2000 masl  over a mile above sea level and shade from trees such as Acacia. Complex flavor, crisp acidity and fruity-sweetness is the result. Its hard to top heirloom varieties grown in their natural habitat.

	During harvest, from October through mid-January, farmers deliver red cherries to Reko. Coffee at the Reko washing station is cleaned in a close-by river, pulped on an heritage Agard pulping machine, and fermented for 36-48 hours before being dried on raised beds for 10-12 days. One might call this processing completely transparent: it imparts nothing to cup, safeguarding the acidity and complexity of these Kochere coffees.

	Having bought from Kochere in years past, we were on lookout for a beautiful Spring coffee to share when this lot from Reko turned our heads. May is early season for Ethiopian coffee, yet, if Rekos fresh crop is portent, then this Summer stands to be superb for these bright, clean, dynamic, crisp and delicious coffees.

	Taste through the seasons at Madcap with the 6-month Roaster's Choice Subscription.

	Only available to customers living in the United States.

	This is the seventh consecutive crop we've purchased from Helsar de Zarcero, an award winning farm and mill. Their harvest and processing methods are precise, with their coffee divided into micro-lots of both organic and conventional and carefully selected for each roaster while the cherries are still on the tree. Ricardo, the owner of Santa Lucia, has a great understanding of the effects that pulping, fermentation, and the drying process have on the coffee. His willingness to work closely with the roasters who buy his coffee, coupled with his skill as a processor, allow him to present fabulous coffees. Over the past few seasons we had the opportunity to hand select a very small and stunning lots from the farm, and neighboring farms yielding dynamic clarity and sweetness.

	In honor of our hometown area code here in Grand Rapids, we dubbed this blend Six One Six. Six One Six is enjoyable, trustworthy, and balanced: designed to be a delicious coffee that everyone can savor and trust everyday, much like the city itself. Embracing our commitment to seasonal changes in coffee harvests, the coffees in Six One Six change throughout the year, lending subtle flavor differences that keep this blend interesting.

	Embracing our dedication to excellent coffees, the Third Coast Espresso blend uses several of our best coffees in the course of the year to produce a luscious espresso: sweet, flavorful, and complex in its pure form, yet robust enough to support milk drinks. Careful observation throughout the year will yield the joy of tasting subtle, seasonal flavor changes. The Third Coast Espresso produces a rich texture, mixed berries, vibrant acidity and a balanced creamy body.

	Of course you can. We strongly encourage you to grind your own coffee to achieve an optimum flavor experience but we will grind coffee on request. Select the appropriate grind in the shopping cart.

	All of our coffees are given a roast level that we feel brings out their best flavor. For us, roasting goes beyond color, which is why we focus more on sharing flavor profiles rather than information on the roast itself. The majority of our coffees are somewhere in the medium-light to medium roast range.

	We are happy to answer, neither. We've developed a way of sourcing coffee that we really believe in and that we feel, at least for us, works better than Fair Trade or Direct Trade. Madcap spends time every year visiting our producers and building relationships on the farm level. We work closely with every link in the supply-chain to ensure that quality and sustainability are top priorities. When buying coffee from farms we haven't yet visited, we use well-established organizations to assist with sourcing that are aligned with our core beliefs and interest in transparency. So in essence, our coffees are both fairly traded and directly traded, just not certified.

	Like all produce, coffee is seasonal. With our sights focused on quality, we purchase our coffee during harvest and only feature it while it lasts, usually about three or four months. We know it can be frustrating to fall in love with a coffee and then have it soon disappear, but think about how exciting it will be next year when its season rolls back around.

	Simply use the bag your coffee comes in, keeping it rolled up tightly and out of the sunlight. We encourage you to use your coffee within one month of the roast date and keep it away from the freezer. Every time you freeze your coffee a Madcap barista loses a tip.

	There are numerous ways to make coffee and no single way is correct. But here's some main pointers:
	1. Use filtered water. Water makes up 90% of your final product, so water quality plays a huge role.
	2. Make sure your water is between 200-205 degrees Fahrenheit. This is necessary to properly extract the awesome flavor.
	3. Grind coffee fresh right before brewing.
	4. Use roughly 10 grams of coffee for every 5 ounces of water.
	5. Have fun and drink responsibly!

	There are many ways to connect with us, but the quickest and easiest is usually email.

We know it can be frustrating to fall in love with a coffee and then have it soon disappear, but think about how exciting it will be next year when its season rolls back around.

	Simply use the bag your coffee comes in, keeping it rolled up tightly and out of the sunlight. We encourage you to use your coffee within one month of the roast date and keep it away from the freezer. Every time you freeze your coffee a Madcap barista loses a tip.

	There are numerous ways to make coffee and no single way is correct. But here's some main pointers:
	1. Use filtered water. Water makes up 90% of your final product, so water quality plays a huge role.
	2. Make sure your water is between 200-205 degrees Fahrenheit. This is necessary to properly extract the awesome flavor.
	3. Grind coffee fresh right before brewing.
	4. Use roughly 10 grams of coffee for every 5 ounces of water.
	5. Have fun and drink responsibly!

	There are many ways to connect with us, but the quickest and easiest is usually email.

Our Global Coffee Harvest Schedule is a rough guide to show you when a harvests generally occur in a country and what months we'll most likely have your favourite coffees available.
We are currently working directly with coffee producers worldwide from Bolivia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, Ethiopia and Kenya to improve the quality of our coffees from the very start of their journey. From the agriculture, processing, and drying stages to the transportation and roasting, we care deeply about producing the best coffee we can buy, and are constantly perfecting it so we can share these coffees with Canada and the world.

At our Calgary, Canada coffee roasterie, we personally ensure our coffees are roasted carefully, leveraging experience and technology to improve consistency in every roast batch. As we roast, we strive to highlight the unique characteristics of each of the coffees we source. The result? What we hope is some of the most delicious coffee you can buy in Canada and maybe even the world.

Browse our coffee online by the distinct regions theyre grown, or explore different taste profiles to find the best coffee for you. You can order any of our in-season coffees directly and well have them delivered right to your door. If youre looking for unroasted coffee, it is available via our green coffee subscription.

- written by Sebastian Sztabzyb -
It all started in a digital circuits class. It was 1996. Phil and I were both at the University of Calgary studying to become engineers. As fate would have it, we were paired as lab partners. Id like to say there was a thunderbolt moment where we both saw our futures unfold in front of us, but it was substantially less monumental than that. We worked well together, largely because were both perfectionists. I never had to convince Phil to stay up late to keep working on a project and he never had to convince me to stay up even later. During our time as lab partners we became friends. We were odd ducks in the world of engineering because while most of our cohorts feasted on pizza and beer, even as scruffy students both Phil and I had a taste for the finer things and bonded over a shared love of fine food and wine.
In 2002 we discovered espresso and just how good or bad it can be. The discovery happened for both of us accidentally and concurrently. For Phil, the revelation was sparked by his late Uncle Billy. When Phil visited Uncle Billy, who was quite the aficionado, Uncle Billy would meticulously prepare espressos for the two of them to enjoy. The process piqued his curiosity and Phil bought a Gaggia Baby espresso machine and began experimenting. Around the same time I was dropping some rather unsubtle hints to my wife Emily that it would be nice to make espressos at home. You can imagine my surprise when on my birthday a Delonghi espresso maker showed up. Despite using nice beans the results were atrocious and I can quite honestly remember asking myself why anyone would bother to drink the crap. After many discussions between Phil and I, along with some fairly extensive research (this is where its beneficial to remember our engineer-like tendencies) the truth was revealed. While Phils Gaggia Bay was a decent espresso machine, my Delonghi was essentially useless and would never produce a drinkable espresso. It was immediately exchanged for a Rancilio Silvia. The results went from atrocious to drinkable, but barely.
Then fate intervened. Sadly, uncle Billy passed away and in his will he left Phil a book, David Schomers Espresso Coffee: Professional Techniques. As ridiculous as it may sound, that book changed our lives. I can honestly say that I dont know where we would be had it not come into Phils possession. It introduced us to the science behind espresso, appealing to the engineer and the budding aficionado in both of us. We were zealots, learning about dosing, distribution, and tamping. We also learned that in order to create a great espresso it was time to invest in another piece of brewing equipment. I went out and purchased a Rancilio Rocky grinder, multiplying my wifes initial investment in my birthday present by tenfold. But finally, we created something drinkable, and although we didnt know it at the time, we had also created Phil & Sebastians first tasting lab. The cinematic progression of our story would involve the swift opening of a coffee shop. In reality that day was still more than half a decade away. And lets just say life had a few curveballs planned for us in the meantime.
The tasting lab, also known as my former kitchen, was operating in full swing and we were starting to experiment with other espressos. It was our first cup of Seattles Vivace Espresso, roasted by the aforementioned David Schomer that really changed the game. If wed looked up to the man before his espresso turned admiration into full-blown obsession. Not only did he have his own roasting business, he also had a small cafe where drinks were served small and without syrups. A road trip was in order. We ignored a lot of sound advice, the March road conditions and a severe avalanche warning and headed to Seattle. In tow were two friends who would both become instrumental in the creation of Phil & Sebastian, Joe Oppenheim, a long time friend, who is now our company lawyer, and Jonathan Herman my brother-in-law, a designer and now a guiding force behind our brand (who, as hard as it is to believe, at the ripe age of 21 had never had a cup of coffee).
When we finally pulled into the parking lot at Vivace both Phil and I were overcome with a strange Beatles-groupie like excitement. We each ordered one cappuccino and one espresso. The cappuccinos were life altering. They were sweet, chocolatey, caramelly, creamy with only the slightest trace of bitterness. There was absolutely no need for cream or sugar, it wouldve been redundant to the already exquisite flavour. Then came the espresso. It was rich, thick like molasses, so smooth and intense with so little bitterness you almost didnt know what you were drinking. Those drinks combined with the relaxed vibe, and the tattooed yet knowledgeable baristas, were what finally brought us to the realization that we needed to open a place of our own in Calgary.
It was during that summer that planning for our own cafe began. Although Phil and I would both consider ourselves fairly proficient at most things in life, naming the business was not our strong suit. We cycled through some embarrassing and in hindsight rather entertaining options such as Ooze Espresso Bar, Atypica Coffee, Latte Art Coffee House (I blame Phil for most of those). We also started putting down on paper our vision, and mission. To date this is one of the most challenging tasks weve undertaken. There was a lot of procrastination, a lot of revisions and a lot of late nights. It reminded me of this scene from Seinfeld where Jerry and George are trying to write script for a show about nothing. After the initial enthusiasm, they find themselves staring into space blankly. This lasts for a few seconds until Jerry remembers he has to call Elaine, and George turns on the television. That was Phil and I. Wed sit down, long stretches of silence would ensue until we came up with a distraction or one presented itself. I am happy to admit that after many painful attempts, and well into the fall of 2005, we had a mission statement. You can read the full version here, but the gist was and still is this: We believe that coffee has great potential for flavour and nuance. We want to introduce this potential to our customers, and help them discover just how great coffee can be.
Although we had cleared a few hurdles there were still many more to come. A major one being we had no real business experience, no experience in the food in beverage industry, no name and only a partial business plan. Fortunately during another bought of internet research, we came across a conference called Coffee Fest held in Seattle. Once again, Jonathan in tow, we headed across the border. We sat in the front row at every single seminar, asked way too many questions and basically scrounged together an education on hiring, retention, pricing drinks and pretty much anything else you could think of. We were introduced to the coffee community, and to a brand-new machine that would change the coffee world. The Clover would allow baristas to brew one cup at a time, changing the parameters of each cup and launching the single-cup brewing phenomenon now seen in pretty much every quality cafe.
It was around that time we finally found our name. It was Jonathan who suggested Phil & Sebastian. At first we werent taken with the idea of naming the company after ourselves, but soon the personal nature, authenticity and the sheer simplicity of the suggestion overcame us, not to mention our other options were all terrible.
Around the same time we secured a name, we also came to the realization that two guys opening a coffee shop without ever having worked at a coffee shop was a dumb idea. So we decided to divide and conquer. My wife Emily and I had a baby on the way, so it was decided I would work on securing a location and finishing up our business plan while Phil would move to Vancouver, work in cafes and immerse himself in the coffee community. Our good friend Joe (who accompanied us to Seattle the first time) lived in Vancouver, and graciously granted Phil use of his couch. Phil quickly found work at the Hines Roasterie. He also visited every coffee shop in sight, and conducted informal interviews with anyone in the coffee business who would grant him an audience. Phil spent eight months in Vancouver. During which he also worked at Caffe Artigiano, and an establishment no longer in operation called Cafe Natura (it proved to be a very valuable lesson in what not to do). Meanwhile I was struggling to find space in Calgary. Commercial rents were at an all-time high, and landlords werent keen on a cafe operated by two fellows with no operational experience.
It was during a trip to the Calgary Farmers Market that we finally stumbled across the solution. It was the perfect place to launch. Wed have low initial-overhead, the customers were more discerning and for the most part people werent in a rush. However there were a few issues, there was a three-year waiting list, and the market already had two coffee shops. Trying to pitch a third wasnt going to go over well, so we decided wed get our foot in the door by pitching a tasting bar for the purposes of selling whole bean coffee and home brewing equipment.
Its important to note that there was a management change going on and the gatekeeper to the GM at the time was a lovely woman named Beverly. Its also important to note that aside from my wife, its generally been women over 50 who have found me the most charming. Beverley bought into the concept immediately, and agreed to pass it onto the GM at the time, Darrell. Unfortunately she wasnt the decision maker. Many weeks elapsed with no word. Finally on November 17th 2006, I headed down to the office uninvited. Beverley seemed nervous but agreed to put me in front of Darrell. He took one look at me and said The answer is no and thats final. Im not sure if it was the shock, the disappointment or the potent combination of both that caused me to launch into an rampant diatribe about how he was missing an opportunity to inject some much needed passion and energy into the market, how nobody in Calgary was doing anything like this, and how the market deserved so much more than its current coffee offering. Im not sure if Darrell was inspired or bemused but something in my speech stirred him, and he told me Come back tomorrow and well figure out how to get you into the market.
The next day I went back. Darrell suggested I approach Bob, the owner of one of the existing coffee shop Bit O Beans, about purchasing his business. Bob had achieved great success at the market with Simple Simon Pies. The coffee business was running as a mediocre offshoot, a second thought to an already thriving enterprise. Darrell also suggested that while I was offering to purchase Bobs business I bring along a six-pack of Becks. I have to be honest, at that point I really had no idea what I was doing. I had no idea how to approach a total stranger and ask to purchase their business. Thankfully Bob is the kind of guy who will spend five hours on a Sunday talking to a total stranger about selling his business as long as that stranger was friendly and happened to bring along a six-pack. The deal to take over Bit OBeans happened slowly and to say informally would be an understatement. Over the next few months, Phil and I had many meetings which were the three of us, a few pints and some incredibly entertaining tales about Bobs youth. In the end we bought Bit O Beans without signing a single document.
Now that we had space secured, and some experience under our belts Phil moved back to Calgary and we got to work. We took possession of Bit O Beans on March 12th 2007. The plan was to open for business on March 30th 2007. Thats a fairly tall order for any start-up but it was an especially tall order considering we were two guys with no budget, no drawings and limited construction know-how. We did however have two of the most sophisticated pieces of brewing equipment in the world, a 3-group La Marzocco FB-80 and a Clover by-the-cup brewer (one of three in all of Canada). At the time they were both living in my basement which was operating as our testing lab and also as an impromptu coffee house with friends stopping by to taste our experiments. We approached Karo Design to help us get things started. The budget we managed to scrounge together was measly and to this day Im not sure why Karo Design agreed to help us, but they did. The construction crew consisted of myself, Phil, my brother Rodrigo who at the time was a carpentry student (hes now a very established cabinet-maker), Jonathan who isnt handy, and Sebastians brother-in-law Lou, who also wasnt handy. We were a sorry excuse for a construction team led by a first-year carpentry student. Thankfully a few fateful turns helped us get things on track, most notably the support of our friend the very capable handyman Bruce Weir. None of us are quite sure how it happened, but by the evening of March 29th we were ready for business. Well, almost ready for business, the cash register wasnt functional so we armed ourselves with a shoebox and a calculator. That night, in a fit of panic that no one but our families would make an appearance, I sent out a 3:00 am email begging everyone Id ever met to please come by. That first weekend was extremely rewarding. Sales were nothing to write home about, but based on customer feedback, we felt we had succeeded in re-creating our amazing beverage experience from Cafe Vivace years prior, only this time we were on the serving side.
On Sunday, local food critic John Gilchrist approached the bar. I nervously took his order, and whispered a very encouraging Dont fuck this up, into Phils ear as he prepared Johns cortado (an espresso with a very small amount of warm milk). Just as he was finishing his cortado, John mentioned that hed like to run a feature on Phil & Sebastian in the Calgary Herald.
Early on the morning of the April 14th Phil and I met at the market having already read the story. Phil asked me what I thought, so I told him. I think its good, right?. Phils neck immediately turned purple, this happens to him during moments of extreme excitement. You THINK its good. Really. Did you read the headline? How much better than Farmers Market Brews Coffee Nirvana can it get? Clearly my nerves had prevented me from absorbing the true sentiment of the article. By 8:15 that morning a line began forming and Phil & Sebastian quickly became a sensation, attracting locals and coffee lovers from across Canada.
It had always been part of our plan to roast our own coffee, so three months into our venture at the market we started looking into it. We purchased a sample roaster, some green coffee and returned to my basement. Things started off pretty shaky. After much experimentation, we were able to bring out a nice warm brown in the beans. Unfortunately the beans looked gorgeous but tasted terrible. So in true engineer fashion, we spent the next fifteen months researching, reading, roasting, cupping, hiring consultants and flying to San Francisco. By September 2008 we werent roasting the best coffee in the world, but we were getting pretty good. We were confident enough in our abilities that it was time to invest in a production roaster.
Finding the right roaster was a tedious and extensively evaluated process. We tasted coffees from around the world and made a list of the machines they were roasted on to see if we could discern a pattern. Nearly all of our favorite coffees all came from reconditioned UG-15 Probats. So we set out to find an old UG-15 and found a 55-year-old beauty that would need extensive work. Truth be told, buying a piece of machinery that was created well before Phil or I were born, and knowing wed have to spend a fair amount of money and time having it refurbished wasnt a prospect that either of us was thrilled with, but wed tasted it ourselves, the Probat was roasting the best coffee in the world. So we commissioned a Dutch company, Giesen, to rebuild the UG-15, and seven months later it arrived. We excitedly began unpacking it like two kids on the first night of Chanukah, only to discover that the whole thing was covered in rust. Our hearts sank. We went to the phones, calling the experts in Holland, our Moms and pretty much anyone else who would listen. We discerned it was only surface rust, and nothing a little elbow grease couldnt set right. Fifteen hours of hard scrubbing later, the roaster looked like new, or as new as a 55 year-old roaster can look. On June 4th 2009 we started our first test roasts. We promised ourselves we wouldnt start selling it at the market until it was as good as the coffee we were currently using, which at the time was Novo coffee from Denver. We threw away and donated more coffee during the next four weeks than I care to think about. But finally, around the first week of July we were serving our own roasted coffee for public consumption.
The first hurdle we encountered when we started roasting was securing a good green coffee supply. Buying from green coffee importers is a bit like playing the lottery (with admittedly better odds and lower upside) in that there are many green coffee offerings to choose from but the chances of finding consistently good coffee is hard. We knew early on that we both philosophically and practically (quality wise) we wanted to purchase direct from producers but didnt really know how to go about it. Our first venture into buying direct happened when we visited Costa Rica in February of 2010 and worked with Francisco Chico Mena from Exclusive Coffees. Francisco is likely one of the key figures responsible for putting Costa Rica back on the map in the quality coffee world. He is passionate and in 2008 had a vision of becoming an exporter solely dedicated at exporting coffee with traceability direct to the producer, something that was rare and frowned upon in Costa Rica at the time. He introduced us to a number of producers in Costa Rica, many of whom we are still working with and have built strong relationships with. People like Ricardo Perez, Macho Arce, Ricardo Calderon and Gilio date back to 2010.
Once we got a taste of buying direct, it became clear that we needed to set a goal to purchase all of our coffee direct by 2012. We also decided to carry coffees from a select limited number of countries in order to keep our travel manageable and to be able to spend proper time with each producer to get to know them, launch projects and see improvements.
One of our founding principles is this concept of continuous improvement so the idea of buying random coffees year after year, even if they taste good, didnt really jibe with our philosophy. Im proud to say that we now buy directly from Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, Bolivia, Kenya and Ethiopia and have launched quality and sustainability projects in nearly all the countries.
Historically green coffee has always been shipped in regular shipping containers, the same kind used for grains, shoes and other non-perishable products. And although there were a few roasters using refrigerated containers it was the exception not the norm. Phil and I ran many tests whereby we used data loggers to track the temperature and humidity variance inside the container. As you can imagine moving coffee from south of the equator up north, there can be a shift of anywhere from 20-60 degrees C. These temperature variances can be a leading contributor to premature aging in green coffee. So, in an attempt to protect the lovely beans, we started shipping all of our beans in refrigerated containers. Its these kinds of initiatives that get us up in the morning. We want to contribute to the industry and help craft the science around creating a great cup of coffee, not unlike the great vintners have done with wine.
Now that we were sourcing and roasting we began to move towards the grand goal of opening our first standalone cafe. It was around this time that we were approached by Walker McKinley of McKinley Burkhart, a very reputable Calgary-based architecture and design firm. At the time we were loosely engaged in discussions with another design firm, but decided to take the meeting anyways. As impressive as their portfolio was, it wasnt what won us over. Not only did they appreciate what we were trying to do with coffee, they also brought a similar level of passion and dedication to their own craft. Much like Phil and I, Walker and Mark are also perfectionists. Its made for some intense conversations, but ultimately very fruitful results.
Shortly after that meeting, we secured the space for our first cafe. We knew we didnt want to churn out lattes like they were coming off a conveyor belt. We wanted a place where people could sit, engage about coffee and savour with more of a neighbourhood vibe. So opening a shop in Marda Loop made a lot of sense. Initially the space was slotted for a Sobeys and they had exclusivity on coffee, fortunately for us that deal fell through. At the time the developer already had another tentative deal but we ultimately won out due to the fact that we were small and locally owned, not a large chain. So with the help of McKinley Burkhart, and Jonathan we began plans to create a space that was noisy, bright, classy and focused entirely around coffee. We had many meetings, many tense meetings, and some outright fights but finally we were ready to begin construction.
On the evening of Friday November 27th, construction was complete and we were ready for business. In the same tradition of panicked pre-opening emails, I once again sent out a late night request begging people to come by. Thankfully on Saturday November 28th, 2009 our first cafe opened to a small crowd, stayed busy all day and has pretty much been that way ever since. It was a banner moment for Phil and I. We had spent six years eating, sleeping and dreaming about creating our own cafe.
There was a fellow named Ron who came by the market fairly regularly. We had good conversations around coffee, and our operations, but it never occurred to me that he was actually conducting informal research until we got a call from our broker asking if we wanted to sit down with Darryl Schmidt the leasing manager for Chinook Centre. Turns out Ron was actually the VP of Cadillac Fairview, the company that owns and operate Chinook, hed tasked Darryl (whom we now affectionately refer to as Schmitty) with figuring out what it would take to get us in there. After our first meeting with Schmitty it was time for some soul searching. A mall wasnt where we saw ourselves. We dont like malls. So it didnt make sense to open in one. But then we went back to our mission statement. If we wanted to bring great coffee to the masses, we needed to go to where the masses were. We went back to Schmitty with our list of demands. We needed our own entrance so it could feel like our own space. We needed space for our own seating area. We needed to not be in the food court. We are not about convenience; we are about an experience so the further people have to walk to find us, the easier it is to engage folks and the more interested they are in what we are doing. We had to create an out-of-mall experience in the mall. Schmitty being the great guy that he is was nothing but accommodating. We opened in September 2010.
Around the same time design started for Chinook, the Calgary Farmers Market announced that it was moving locations. We loved being in the market, loved the energy, the customers, and the vendors (most of them), but because of struggles at the board level there wasnt an articulate vision of where the market was going, and we decided it didnt make sense for us to continue on. It was with heavy hearts we said goodbye and parted ways.
It was 2011. Sales at Chinook were not what we had hoped. We had just closed down a profitable operation at the market and we were losing money at an alarming rate. We hadnt encountered this kind of adversity before. During those first three years wed largely made decisions without ever considering the financial implications; our main goals as a business werent monetary so it hadnt felt necessary. But we shortly realized that the sustainability of Phil & Sebastian would require us to pay more attention to how we spent our time and our money. There wasnt a magic button, or genius insight, we just didnt panic. Or we didnt panic a lot. We stuck with what we knew we were good at: making tasty coffee and sharing it with Calgary. We also developed a more responsible approach to our finances. By the end of the year we were close to breaking even.
Our overarching goal throughout this process had been to share how great coffee could truly be, so a mobile coffee bar seemed to make a lot of sense. We worked with Aerotech Metal and designed a modular coffee bar that would fit nicely into a trailer. Unfortunately as enjoyable as it was making coffee outdoors at various festivals, the logistics made the endeavour too time and effort intensive to be financially viable. We decided the mobile cafe should act as a semi-permanent installation staying in place for a few weeks at a time. Our first opportunity came at Holt Renfrew, which we were initially wary of. We believe we offer a high-end product, but weve always strived to remain approachable. Of course, there were advantages to partnering with Holts, it offered some great exposure and a test of the downtown market. We decided to go for it and two weeks turned into 18 months. But in the end the relationship didnt make sense. Although the management at Holts Calgary was super nice, our location wasnt ideal, the store hours and coffee drinking hours werent aligned, and ultimately it just wasnt a perfect fit for our respective brands.
One of the highlights of our mobile espresso bar stint was our introduction to the Calgary Folk Festival. In 2011, we setup our mobile espresso bar at the Folk Fest. It was actually our first mobile event and we barely survived it. We were not really prepared to launch, let alone at an event featuring thousands of cold, coffee-deprived music fans. Nonetheless, we enjoyed Folk Fest a great deal and our involvement in the festival has grown every year since then and since 2013, we have been the coffee sponsors of the event and have served almost 30,000 coffees in that span.
We first participated at the Canadian Barista Championships in 2008. Its a strange subculture of coffee nerds, but as you can imagine we found ourselves very much at home and weve been hooked ever since. In 2009, one of our baristas, Ben Put competed in the precursor to the national competition and came in first, much to our dismay he didnt qualify for finals at the nationals but in some ways it was for the best. It lit a fire in Phil and I and we were determined to help Ben improve. Since then, weve been fortunate to enjoy a great deal of success. We have finished second or first in Canada every year since 2010. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, Ben finished second. In 2012, we groomed another one of our baristas, Jeremy Ho, helping him win the Canadian Barista Championship. Phil and I coached Jeremy to a 9th place finish out of 53 countries, which we all felt pretty good about. In 2013, we helped Ben get through the hump and he finally won the Canadian Barista Championship. Another barista from our team, Megan Feniak, placed 4th, making her the top-ranked female barista in the country. This was an amazing accomplishment for Megan, especially considering she was a first-time competitor.
In 2013 I got a call from Darrell (the old GM of the Calgary Farmers Market who along with Bob gave us our start) telling me that he had found the perfect northwest location for us. Of course I was skeptical, but because of our history I took the meeting. He drove me out to a very large, multi-level log house that had once been used for events. The roof was falling apart, there were more than a few dead birds and it had the distinct odor of neglect. I wasnt sold. Then Darrell started sharing his vision for the property. He wanted to turn it into a farmers market, and had long-term plans for revitalizing the entire property. I still wasnt sold, but agreed to stay in touch. I headed back with Phil by my side a few months later, unfortunately the property was in pretty much the same condition. I believe the term Phil used was gross, which accurately echoed my own initial impression. Still Darrells vision was becoming more and more apparent in my mind, again we agreed to stay in touch. Another month went by and we returned, this time the charm didnt require so much imagination. We decided to jump on board, we moved the mobile bar from Holt Renfrew and on July 18th opened up at Symons Valley Ranch. It feels great to be back at a farmers market and the ranch is quickly becoming a go-to northwest destination.
Wed known for a long time we wanted to open a location in the charming Mission district. The vibe of the neighbourhood felt like the right fit. So when we had to opportunity to open on what is known as the Maxwell Bates block, named after the local artist, we jumped. We reunited with Walker and Mark from McKinley Burkart and got to work. When we began designing the Mission cafe, we were intent on creating a completely different cafe experience. We were tired of the fast food model of cafes where you order here and pickup there. We had, and still have, a good idea of how to change this. Unfortunately, rent on 4th street is ridiculously expensive and the space required to do what we want to do is simply too much for this location, so it may have to wait until another day (hint, hint: Simmons). We had long since toyed with the idea of serving a small, curated menu of wine and beer and this seemed like the right time to do it. We worked with our friends Elliot and Matt from Highlander Wine & Spirits and Eric from Dreamwines to create a small menu that fits with the cafe  elegant, approachable and tasty. We didnt want to become a bar, we just wanted to add another dimension to the evening vibe, and so far weve done exactly that.
Downtown Calgary is an interesting place. For the most part, the foot traffic is concentrated to the +15 network, which is full of cafes and coffee kiosks that are based on convenience and speedy service, most of them with little regard to quality and experience. We get it, downtown people are working, they are busy and they are in a rush, the mostly dont care where the coffee is coming from, who grows it and whether it tastes like mango or pear. We have never been or will ever be about convenience. Weve always been a destination and thats the hope for our one-day downtown cafe. Were looking for character in the space and we dont need to be the most convenient cafe in downtown, it needs to be right. Unfortunately, there are only a few spots that meet the criteria in all of downtown, so we will wait patiently until the day comes when these character spaces become available. Until then, well be staying out of downtown.
In January 2012 we got a call asking if wed be interested in opening a cafe in the East Village. Our initial reaction was Not interested. We need people to have a cafe. But we decided to swing by and check out the neighbourhood. During our tour of the East Village, we drove by the Simmons building and something instantly clicked, and we knew we wanted to be part of it. It had been in the back of our heads for some time to combine a roasterie with a cafe and this felt like the perfect fit. But the space was bigger than we needed for even that, so we decided if we were really going to turn the Simmons building into a place that attracted people from morning until night, we needed to call on a few friends. That day, I called John and Connie from Charcut, and Aviv from Sidewalk Citizen and asked them to come a look at the space with us. Within five minutes everyone was onboard. Together we submitted a proposal to the city that envisioned the building as a concept cafe, roasterie, bakery, deli and restaurant, a deep-knit collaboration between three partners allowing us to offer a completely unique culinary experience. Were now in the design stage and so far its proven to be a tricky endeavour, all three partners have to balance their individual needs with the common good of the space but were all excited with how it will come together and are really looking forward to seeing the role the space plays in shaping the neighbourhood.
When we designed the Mission cafe, we really wanted to reinvent the cafe experience and this will be the goal at Simmons: to make customers slightly uncomfortable. I dont mean that in a rude way, but we want to push customers out of their comfort zone so we can all share in a new experience.
I dont think either Phil or I is entirely sure on what the future holds. What we do know is that for both of us this has always been a labour of love. Were engineers and coffee lovers first, and businesspeople second. Along the way the bumps on the road have taught us to keep an eye towards sustainability, but for the most part our focus is where its been since day one, creating great coffee and sharing it with folks that appreciate it. Despite our growing business we still get to spend an inordinate amount of time being coffee nerds, which is exactly how we like it.

For a limited run, we are very excited to introduce a new lineup of menu items available exclusively at our cafes that contain cascara. We worked with Helsar de Zarcero in Costa Rica, a quality-focused micro-mill, to bring it in.
Cscara is Spanish for husk or skin, and refers to the dried skins of coffee cherry. Normally, the whole coffee cherry is processed in order to obtain the seed of the fruit, and the skins are discarded or re-used for compost. To process it, the pulped skins are collected after the seeds (or beans) have been removed, and carefully dried for export. Cascara is still fairly new in the specialty world, and is usually not found served in cafes.
Cascara is found somewhere in the intersection between coffee and tea  even though it comes from the coffee plant, the drink does not taste anything like coffee, as it is the dried fruit portion of the coffee cherry. The most common way to consume it is to steep it with hot water as a tea, and it is typically described as having a sweet, fruity taste with notes of rose hip, hibiscus, and red currant.
YES! Cascara has 111.4 mg/L, compared to a broad range of about 400-800 mg/L in normal, brewed coffee.
We worked with Helsar de Zarcero, which is a quality-focused micro-mill located in Costa Rica. They worked together with a research team from the University of Costa Rica to develop a process that would yield great results. Phil & Sebastian has worked with closely with the Helsar Mill  you may remember coffees from producers such as Ricardo Perez, Miguel Rojas, Filipe Rodriguez, and Manuel Macho Arce.
How is Phil & Sebastian serving it?
For a limited time, we are offering 3 cascara-based menu at our cafe locations (Mission, Chinook, and Marda Loop):
With notes of rose hip, mulled apple cider, raisins, and red currant  it is steeped with hot water to create a traditional fruit tea:
Notes of cereal milk, malty Ovaltine, rose hip, and ginger bread  this version of a tea latte has cascara infused into milk as its being steamed.
And, last but not least, the most creative way you can try cascara is with our cascara donut. Its a freshly-baked donut made in-house, and dusted with cascara sugar.
This is something new and unique that we are introducing exclusively to our cafe locations  if youre in Calgary, please come in to check it out!

I was in Colombia this past week visiting Martha Reina, the Guzman Brothers and Jose Martinez. Although I could write ad nauseam about each of the visits, I want to focus on my time with Jose Martinez. But before I dive into this last visit, I think its worth learning a bit about the story of how we began to work together.
My first meeting with Jose Martinez turned out to be a true reflection of his personality. I first met him in November of 2014, during a visit to Colombia. I was at the Virmax warehouse in Pitalito, Huila, when Javier Rojas, the agronomist for Virmax, introduced me to an energetic fellow. The introduction was impactful because Javier, whose opinion I value a great deal, introduced Jose as one of the most quality focused producers in the area. I was instantly impressed by Joses demeanour and thirst for knowledge.
Naturally, Jose asked me if I would taste his coffee, but I told him I had to leave for the airport within half an hour so it would be very difficult. Jose pleaded wait for me, dont leave!, then jumped on his motorbike and sped out of the lot. He returned 29 minutes later with four green coffee samples and said, please taste them in Canada and tell me what you think. Days later, I cupped them with Phil and they were outstanding.
In May of 2015, I visited Joses farm and learned a little more about him. He was born on the very same coffee farm, where he first learned about coffee from his father. When he was 16 he decided to leave the farm and ended up becoming a bus driver. He did this for over a decade until he decided to return to the farm and follow in his fathers footsteps. Although he now regrets temporarily leaving the farm, he feels the time away developed a fire within him to become a better coffee producer. This fire was abundantly evident when visiting his farm. The farm is not overly planted and has plenty of natural shade. The trees look very healthy and well pruned.
I am starting to see that what separates Jose from most producers is his desire to do things right. When he built his fermentations tanks, he initially wanted to tile the entire room (walls, floor and ceiling) to create a very clean and presentable environment. Most quality focused producers manage to tile the fermentation tanks and thats all, but for Jose thats not good enough, its not presentable enough, not clean enough. For cash-flow related reasons, he is doing the improvements in stages, so he is not done with the tiling of the fermentation area, but hes well on his way.
In May, I noticed that his drying infrastructure was holding him back. He was drying coffee on the roof of his house (a very common system used in Colombia with a rollaway roof called Casa Elba). Without me saying anything, he said I know my drying is not good, I am going to build a proper patio, do you have any advice for me? I was a bit shocked to hear him seek information so openly, as most producers tend to resist change. Having had some experience with successful drying projects in Colombia and other countries, I was happy to offer some suggestions. We chatted about drying for quite a while and then hetold me you will see great changes in my drying before you come back in November.
During my visit this past week, I got to once again experience Joses quest for perfection first hand. When I pulled up to his house, I saw his new (nearly finished) drying structure. Its a work of art. Once again, his desire to do things the right way was evident and impressive. I have seen many drying structures and Joses has a great deal of innovation and attention to detail. For instance, many producers fasten the plastic to the extremities and theres always some leftover plastic that over hangs  although it doesnt affect the function of the drying, it looks a bit untidy. In Joses case, the plastic was perfectly and neatly installed. With this help of his partner, Francy, he also devised a system for neatly raising and lowering the plastic curtains for increased airflow during the daytime. He is using shade in his dryer but its not permanently installed as he is working on spring based system for managing the shade curtain on top of his drying structure. Jose cares a great deal abouthis farm and processing always looking very neat and clean, as well as being easy to use and efficient. Its truly impressive.

Joses new drying structure. Built with love and precision.
During the visit, Jose kept showing me things that he is going to improve. He has a clear vision and a desire to invest in his farm and infrastructure. Its very refreshing to see and its impact is becoming very clear as I taste more and more of his coffee. Jose and I spoke about a three-year plan for the farm that includes drying improvements, wet mill improvements, planting different and interesting varieties and continuing to protect the soil. He often refers to his farm as a garden rather than a farm, I found this little detail very interesting.
I very much enjoy spending time with Jose and Francy. They are fun people, thirsty for knowledge, and determined to improve in every way. It also doesnt hurt that they share my passion for good, local food. I now have to prepare before visiting the farm by not eating for 24 hours so that I can finish my very large meals at the farm.
Sancocho, home-grown chicken, avocado from the farm and salad.
Joses farm is in a small region in the south of Huila called Palestina. During this trip I also had an opportunity to explore Palestina and was impressed by the amount of shade still remaining in this area. Its such a treat to see so much shade since the practice of growing coffee under shade has been all-but-lost in Colombia. I was able to spend time with Jose cupping his coffee and a number of his neighbours and was entertained as Jose was constantly keeping score and proud every time his coffee defeated his neighbours coffees on the cupping table, which happened every time we cupped. I can see that he is extremely proud and competitive. I am very happy to be working with Jose.
You can purchase Joses coffee here.

The region of Santa Barbara in Honduras has something quite special. A combination of soil, weather and coffee varietals make the coffees in this area some of the most exotic and interesting coffees in the world. This harvest will mark the 4th season since we started working with the producers in Santa Barbara. One of these great producers is Margarito Herrera. Margarito lives in the upper end of El Cielito, one of the tiny coffee producing municipalities of Santa Barbara. His dad, Juan Rodriguez, once had a good amount of land in the region, and gave most of it away to his children. Juan, along with his children, historically sold their coffee to the mercado corriente, the commodity market. They lived a simple life in poverty, barely making ends meet.
Margarito and his family. Juan is wearing the yellow shirt.
I first visited Santa Barbara in December of 2012. I visited San Vicente, a local exporter largely responsible for the development of this region. I travelled around the area with Arturo Paz, one of the principals of San Vicente, who amongst many other things, is responsible for QC of the coffees. Arturo and I went to visit Margarito, who had decided to submit a sample of coffee to see the potential and decide if he wanted to begin selling coffee as specialty as opposed to commodity. This was not an easy decision at the time, since specialty is much more time-consuming and demands a lot more attention to detail. I was instantly intrigued by Margaritos potential since the upper El Cielito region is tiny and the few producers who have farms there all have amazing coffee. Arturo and I returned to the lab at San Vicente later that day and roasted and cupped Margaritos coffee. We were both blown away. Powerful fruit, vibrant acidity, nectar-like sweetness  an instant winner. I committed to buying all of Margaritos harvest ever since.
Our model and my approach has been to share some of our lessons learned from our green buying projects with Margarito. Then, explore with him whether any of these may help him improve his coffee. Finally, we work together to introduce some changes to his processing with the hopes of seeing improvements in his coffee and creating more consistency.  For him, consistency is important as it allows him to have peace of mind that the coffee will find a good market (i.e. he will receive a good amount of money for it).
When I visited again in March of 2013, I also met Margaritos father Juan, and we agreed to add his coffee to Margaritos so we can also purchase all of Juans production. Between the two of them, they produced a mere 12 bags. That year Margarito also entered a 10-bag lot into the Honduras Cup of Excellence, where he placed 19th and used the money from the CoE to purchase some more land the highlands of El Cielito. After the 2013 harvest, we continued to work with Margarito and Juan to help them build proper infrastructure. By 2014, they had re-done their fermentation tanks and Margarito built a very nice parabolic sun drier so he could dry his own coffee  the coffee was once again amazing.
In 2015, Margarito further improved his drying by adding shade to the dryer and, thanks to the upper farm, Margarito was able to now produce 18 bags to export. Comparing to 2012 at commodity prices, his earnings from coffee multiplied a whopping 10 times! This is due to receiving much higher prices, but also to the fact that thanks to the higher prices, he was able to invest more into the productivity of his farm.
A view of the Yojoa Lake from Margaritos house.
During this visit, I wanted to pick Margarito and Juans brains and find out if they are happy with our arrangement, both financially and operationally. Financially, I can see with my own eyes the improvement in their living conditions. When I first visited Margarito, there was no road to his house, his house was one single big room, with mud floors and an outdoor bathroom. Now, he has built a new house which is definitely much more comfortable than before. He assured me he is happy and grateful for having the peace of mind that were buying his coffee at a very good price. Operationally, I wanted to make sure that all the details I asked them to do over the last few years are viable and sustainable for their coffee production. Both him and Juan felt that although some of the asks seemed onerous at first, they and their workers have become used to them now and they are able to do them without major headaches.
The other purpose of the visit was to deliver Margarito and Juan some bonuses for achieving certain milestones. Before the harvest, I had agreed to pay them a bonus of $150 USD if all of their coffee was dried to the right endpoint and if the coffee still tasted great a few months after arriving in Calgary. They nailed both of these and so I was happy to pay them the money. They were both extremely grateful and happy, especially because receiving money during the non-harvest period is particularly helpful for their cash flow. Although $150USD may not seem like a lot in Canada, it goes a long way in the remote hills of El Cielito.
Finally, we chatted about the upcoming harvest. Since their production has steadily increased, they are in need of another drying structure. For Margarito and Juan, this is a difficult time of year to spend money, since they dont receive funds from their coffee until the end of their harvest (June). In order to facilitate the investment, I agreed to finance the cost of the materials for a new dryer, which will help them dry the coffee without worrying about capacity. This is especially important since this year Margarito and Juan will be drying their coffee in 100% shade, which will prolong drying times but greatly help in maintaining the coffees high quality over time. 
This year we will also be trying out coffee from Margaritos niece Rosely. She has a farm next to Margarito and is wanting to also work with us under a similar arrangement. Although I have never tasted Roselys coffee, I have little doubts it will be amazing since she has the same varieties as Margarito and very similar growing conditions. We will also be doing a very similar incentive program for quality control which I will be paying out during my pre-harvest visit next year. Margaritos coffee has improved every year since 2013 and I cant wait to see what happens this coming year.
I am personally very proud to work the Margarito. His work ethic and tenacity have been the keys to his success and I have enjoyed being able to play a small role in his growth as a coffee producer.
You can still find some of Margaritos 2015 harvest here.

Chinook is meant to provide people with a reprieve from the mall experience. It features materials like barn wood, brick and steel to give it a rustic, yet fresh look.
We presently brew coffees with a Chemex and Able Kone 3. We have two Uber Boilers and use an Uber grinder. We use a 3M Reverse Osmosis system to deliver water around 70PPM.
Chinook is stacked with espresso equipment; featuring two La Marzocco Mistrals with custom made Strada MP paddles. We use Anfim grinders and also have a Kees van der Westen Mirage Lever machine that we use presently for tastings and demonstrations.
Our menu is constantly changing with the seasons and mirrors our coffee program.
Our food philosophy is quite simple. Theres peace of mind in knowing where our food comes from  that the ingredients we use are from small, quality-driven farms, mostly located right here in Alberta. These ingredients are usually only found in high-end restaurants (accompanied by high-end restaurant prices), but were committed to using these same artisanal ingredients in a casual caf menu.Here are some of the producers we work with: Vital Greens,D Dutchmen Dairy,The Fresh Squeeze,Coco Karamel,Winters Turkey,Ewe-Nique Farms,Sylvan Star Cheese,Highwood Crossing,Yum Bakery,Valbella and Sidewalk Citizen.
Chinook features a variety of baked goods, treats, sandwiches, soups and salads. We bake most of our baked goods ourselves daily in the (very small) Chinook kitchen.

Our friendship with Aviv Fried started back in 2008 and weve been working with him and his bakery, Sidewalk Citizen, ever since. Over the past year, we decided to work more closely together and offer a wide range of Sidewalk Citizen treats at the cafes.

Our brewing methods change frequently and presently, we are using the AeroPress method. We use a Quooker for hot water delivery and Bonavita kettles to brew the coffees. We use an Everpure Reverse Osmosis system to deliver water around 70PPM.
We decided to change it up with Mission, sporting a 3-group Kees van der Westen Spirit machine and a pair of Nuova Simonelli Clima Progrinders.
Our menu is constantly changing with the seasons and mirrors our coffee program.
Our food philosophy is quite simple. Theres peace of mind in knowing where our food comes from  that the ingredients we use are from small, quality-driven farms, mostly located right here in Alberta. These ingredients are usually only found in high-end restaurants (accompanied by high-end restaurant prices), but were committed to using these same artisanal ingredients in a casual cafe menu. Here are some of the producers we work with: Vital Greens, D Dutchmen Dairy, The Fresh Squeeze, Coco Karamel, Winters Turkey, Ewe-Nique Farms, Sylvan Star Cheese, Highwood Crossing, Yum Bakery,Valbella and Sidewalk Citizen.
Mission features a variety of baked goods, treats, sandwiches, soups and salads. We bake most of our baked goods ourselves daily in the Mission kitchen.

Our friendship with Aviv Fried started back in 2008 and weve been working with him and his bakery, Sidewalk Citizen, ever since. Over the past year, we decided to work more closely together and offer a wide range of Sidewalk Citizen treats at the cafes.
Were as serious about our beer as we are about our coffee. To that end, we endeavour to offer a bottle list that rivals the best in Calgary. Well carry seasonal and special releases and look for breweries willing to take risks and push the limits of traditional styles.
Both Sebastian and Phil are passionate about wine, in fact, it was their segue into coffee. As such, were very excited to bring unique and approachable wine offerings to our cafes. These are the wines that fly under the radar and quietly way-out-drink their price point.

We are currently working directly with coffee producers worldwide from Bolivia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, Ethiopia and Kenya to improve the quality of our coffees from the very start of their journey. From the agriculture, processing, and drying stages to the transportation and roasting, we care deeply about producing the best coffee we can buy, and are constantly perfecting it so we can share these coffees with Canada and the world.

At our Calgary, Canada coffee roasterie, we personally ensure our coffees are roasted carefully, leveraging experience and technology to improve consistency in every roast batch. As we roast, we strive to highlight the unique characteristics of each of the coffees we source. The result? What we hope is some of the most delicious coffee you can buy in Canada and maybe even the world.

This coffee is nice and fresh from harvest, composed of lots from this last June-August. All three brothers (Alirio, Abelardo, and Audenar), that weve historically worked with, contributed to this lot, but Audenar (the eldest brother) has the highest percentage contribution. We also have introduced a new brother to the mix: Eulices (yes, there are a lot of brothers!).
The Guzman brothers own and manage their small farms near the town of La Plata in the Huila Region of Colombia. We have worked with the Guzman family since 2011, and during these years, Sebastian has visited them about half a dozen times.
As a company, we cut our teeth on many new processes with them, from cherry picking (ripeness) initiatives to drying structure design, to fermentation and soaking experiments, to moisture, humidity and temperature data collection initiatives. Additionally, the Guzmans are the first producers to whom we offered micro-financing to support improvements to their infrastructure and to purchase equipment.
Truthfully, we havent always had smooth sailing, and weve learned a lot of lessons along the way. Sebastian has had many open and frank discussions with the brothers at their homes and on their farms (in La Plata, Colombia). We may have a romantic notion of what coffee farming looks like, thousands of miles away from producing countries. However, on the ground, producers face numerous real challenges that have them asking the question: Is quality worth it? To you and I, its an obvious and resounding yes!, but its not always so clear cut for them. In spite of these challenges, the Guzmans quality has been steadfast over the last harvests.
Like most coffees in the area, this lot is comprised of Caturra and Colombia varieties. It is debatable how the varieties contribute individually to the cup character, but the result is quintessentially Colombian with an added level of complexity and refinement.
PRODUCER: Alirio, Abelardo, Eulices and Audenar Guzman
REGION: El Carmen, Huila
VARIETY: Caturra, Colombia
ELEVATION: 1800m
PROCESSING: Washed (24-hour Dry Ferment, 12-hour Soak)

This decaf coffee is from one of our long time producing partners: The Bonilla Family. This decaf represents coffee from three of the Bonilla family farms: El Llano, El Cedral and Los Nacientes. They have many farms, but these are our three favourite. We have worked on a few projects with the Bonilla Family, including last year, when we launched a drying project with Pablo Bonilla to slow the drying of his coffee. The results of this project were so successful, that they have subsequently altered drying protocols at the Bonillas.
Don Mayo is by no means a small operation, exporting some 8 containers of coffee
per year (about 300,000 lbs). Normally, a mill of this size in Costa Rica would be less appealing to us, but the Bonillas are committed to reinvesting their profits to upgrade their infrastructure, and consequently they improve their coffee each season. In the last few years, much of their investments have been to purchase new coffee processing equipment. For example, their new top-of-line de-pulper does a much better job of rejecting under- ripe cherries, and their dry mill setup enables them to density sort parchment (coffee before the last layer of skin is removed) greatly improving the removal of under-ripe and defective coffee beans. Some of their other quality measures have been in place since our first visit in 2009 such as a hand sorting line to hand-pick-out defects, a very rare setup in Costa Rica. And perhaps most importantly, they also have an excellent sample roasting and cupping lab.
The Bonilla family owns and operates the Don Mayo wet and dry mills, as well as their 10 farms. Don Hector Bonilla (son of Amado Bonilla, the original Don Mayo) runs the show with the help of his children (all adults now): Pablo, Josue, and Auxiliandora.
Now a bit about why we chose Swiss Water. Weve gotten to know some of the folks behind the scenes at Swiss Water, and theyre simply great coffee people. Theyre always striving to improve their processes and the resulting decaf quality. Just in the last 5 years, their decaf quality has advanced exponentially. Swiss water is based in Burnaby, BC and not Switzerland, although the Swiss Water process was invented in Switzerland in 1933 but was first commercialized by Swiss Water (the company) in Burnaby in 1988.

We have followed Miguel Rojas coffee closely since 2010, and have been partnered with him since 2012. Our relationship with him has strengthened each year, and his quality of cup is second to none in Costa Rica at present. Fruit-forward acidity and sweetness abound in this coffee.
Miguel Rojas is a small coffee producer from the picturesque region of Llano Bonito de Naranjo in the West Valley of Costa Rica. Miguel grows primarily the Caturra variety, although he also has a bit of Typica Villalobos variety. This Typica Villalobos certainly contributes to the elegance of his coffee. Miguel is known as one of the best partner producers of Helsar de Zarcero. Helsar is arguably the best coffee mill in Costa Rica and is owned and operated by one of the nicest and most genuine people we have met: Ricardo Perez. We have been working with Ricardo since 2010, and every year our friendship has been strengthened.
We have been partnered with Miguel since 2012, but have followed his coffee closely since 2010. His farm enjoys some of the highest altitudes in Llano Bonito. This altitude, coupled with the great care he has for his farm and mixed varieties, produces a very fruit-forward coffee with a very sweet and elegant acidity. Miguel also recognizes the importance of keeping his cherry pickers happy, so he pays them well above the minimum and demands very good quality picking in return.
Sebastian has had the pleasure of meeting with Miguel a number of times now, and has developed a nice friendship and a good deal of respect for him. While Miguel spends most of his time on the coffee farm, he also has an interesting side business with his sons: he breeds cows. Although at first take this sounds like a fairly straightforward business, there are many idiosyncrasies that separate the good breeders from the badmuch like good coffee producers from bad.
Miguel is also part of a program we launched with Ricardo called sangre de toro. This term means bulls blood, which is the colour the coffee cherries take on when they are picked very ripe. Sebastian pays Miguel a premium for exceptional cherry delivery and, in turn, Miguel pays his pickers more. The improved picking has resulted in a sweeter and more complex cup.
This coffee went through an experimental drying protocol at Helsar this past year. The protocol was part of a project we launched with Ricardo back in 2013, aimed at extending drying times. The purpose of extending the drying time is essentially to preserve both the quality and shelf life of the green bean. The project focused on doubling the drying times and resulted in a remarkable improvement in shelf life. The coffee is cupping far better than virtually every other Costa Rican coffee available currently.

			We really love Costa Rica: the people, the landscape, and, most importantly, the coffee. Our love affair with sourcing from this country began in 2010, and in that time weve been lucky to partner with many great producers and mills. Whats most exciting about Costa Rican coffee is the producers have the education, means and incentive to invest in their farm and turn their coffees from great to truly exceptional.

On our first visit to Costa Rica we established a friendship and partnership with Juan Ramon Alvarado and Francisco Mena, the owners of Exclusive Coffee, at the time, a start-up boutique exporter. Through this partnership, we have established some amazing relationships and forged some meaningful friendships with producers.
In 2010, we began working with Ricardo Perez and Marvin Rodrigues, owners of a mill called Helsar de Zarcero. This partnership has flourished as we have invested in working with several of the mills best producers and have devel-oped long-standing relationships with them. Over the past five years, we have expanded our scope to include some great relationships with producers across the country from the West Valley to Tarrazu.
Most notably, we have worked on two projects with Helsar: one to improve the drying of the coffee and help improve shelf life and another initiative to help farmers pick better coffee cherry. We have seen success with both of these initiatives but, while picking culture has proven hard to change, our drying projects have proliferated and have now been implemented with all of our partners.
The drying projects involve significant commitment from each producer. The infrastructure is not simple, the logistics are detailed and the amount of time required is onerous. We work closely with each producer to ensure that this process goes smoothly and we visit their farms two or three times a year to help them make any necessary tweaks. We have seen great results from these projects and have seen significant improvements in how long they last without losing vibrancy. We communicate throughout the year and provide feedback to the producers, always thinking about projects for the upcoming harvest.

This coffee from the Guji zone in Ethiopia is the product of the intense attention to detail that is afforded on the small farms in the area. Phil has seen significant progress in the area in the last few years, and we are happy to bring you thisdelicious coffee.
The zone of Guji has been getting particular attention over the last few years. Phil visited Guji on his first trip to Ethiopia many years ago, and he noted that it was significantly less developed than neighbouring areas. However, over the last few years the area has seen progress, development and great quality advancements in coffee quality. This coffee is from a private washing station in the Guji district in the kebele (neighbourhood) of Dimtu Wamena. The station is owned by Mekuria Mergia and he receives coffee from over 700 producers in the area. The small land-holders in the area have properties ranging in altitude from 1650m to 1800m. These altitudes are actually a bit a low compared to Yirgacheffe, the northern neighbour, and it is on average about 2 degrees C warmer in this area of Guji as a result. This temperature difference likely impacts the coffee taste profile, however, its very difficult to pin-down exactly how. Perhaps its in the fruit character of the flavour profile, which tends towards orchard fruit like apple and pear, instead of the classic peach of Yirg. The black tea is still pronounced as is the meyer lemon juicy acidity and milky body. As mentioned above, there are over 700 producers contributing to this coffee, and that might beg the question: how is lot consistency achieved? First off, the small-scale producer is the norm in Ethiopia, whether they sell their coffee to a co-op or private mill. There are, of course, very large farms in Ethiopia as well; however, in Phils experience, the best quality is consistency coming from the small-scale producers. Phils thought on this is that the small producer, by the very nature of being small, is able to focus a lot more on quality. Beginning with the agriculture, which is mostly passive organic (almost natural forest-like), small scale farms might have only 120 or so trees on their property to tend. A focused effort on spreading compost and dead-fall on each tree is very feasible. At harvest time, when it comes to picking, the family is all involved, and the cherry is laid-out on the property after picking and before submission to the washing station. The coffee is picked through to ensure that only ripe cherry is included. Again, immaculate sorting is possible because the cherry can be spread out in one thin layer for evaluation.
The key for these small-scale farmers is that the price paid for coffee cherry must be sufficient for them to afford to make a living off of a small piece of land. This is only achieved when buyers pay high prices for top quality, which we have done with this lot. This premium gets pushed down the chain as a second payment to the coffee growers. This is the key to economic sustainability!

One of the most popular single-cup brewing devices.
It might look unconventional, but it makes a nice cup of coffee with relative ease and simple cleanup. Coffee fans around the world love the AeroPress and it is one of our favourite brewing methods. Interestingly, it's created by the same people who brought us the Aerobie frisbee. We like it because it's simple to make one cup at a time, produces great flavour articulation, and is relatively easy to clean. However, because it only makes one cup at a time, if you're entertaining youll need patient friends!

			We have partnered up with our friends from O5 Tea, who we believe source some of the best teas in the world. We recognize that O5 does with tea what we do with coffee. Theybelieve that tea is grown, not manufactured. Theyfollow an obsessive sourcing process that involves direct relationships with growers and frequent travel to origin, because better Earth yields better leaves. Our collective aim: we would like you to enjoy an outstanding cup.

The Symons coffee bar is rustic and simple, almost blending nicely with its surroundings.  The market is busy and loaded with energy on the weekends.  Its a fun bar where we get a chance to just do what we love: make coffee all day long.
The Symons coffee bar sports our original Calgary Farmers Market La Marzocco FB-80, which has made a lot of drinks, but is still alive and ticking and, in many ways, it is still our favourite machine. We are using Anfim grinders (not the original ones from the market, those died long ago).
We presently brew drip coffee at the Symons bar. Space is very tight so trying to do by-the-cup is nearly impossible.

			Sourcing and roasting exceptional coffees is an all-consuming fervor and we love to find partners with a passion that rivals our own. With our wholesale program, we strive to not only supply amazing coffee that will make your menu shine, but for a lasting partnership where we can work with you to help your business grow.
		
Have Questions? We have answers
I have a new caf and not much coffee experience, can you help me?
Yes! Our extensive wholesale training program is created to make sure you get the experience you need. Our four busy cafes in Calgary demonstrate first hand that an investment in staff training pays off. All of our highly skilled baristas have undergone extensive in-house coffee training. Using this knowledge, well develop a training plan and schedule that works for you in order to create a quality-focused coffee program at your cafe or restaurant.
Yes! With awesome equipment, you have the right tools to ensure the coffee tastes great. Knowing this, we try to make the finest equipment accessible to you and will recommend the options that best suit your business needs. Our equipment expertise is rooted in extensive testing, as weve put many espresso machines and grinders through rigorous evaluations to ensure we can help you decide which would work best for you. Additionally, we have developed relationships with several manufacturers and are able to offer competitive pricing on equipment.
Absolutely. Our coffee program can be tailored to fit the specific requirements for your restaurant. Contact us for more details.
Simply put, we want to work with any cafe or restaurant that is willing to put in the time and effort to deliver great coffee. No real experience with coffee is necessary. Its our job to equip you with the knowledge! And most importantly, its our job to make this process as easy and painless as possible. That means each setup recommendation is tailored to fit a specific scenario. The equipment and process we recommend for use in a restaurant will be very different than, for example, a cafe with more focus on coffee as an offering.
Weve negotiated fantastic shipping rates with FedEx to Canada and the United States, and we also ship worldwide. We even offer free shipping for wholesale orders over a certain size. Contact us for details. 
Yes! We love working with quality cafs in the United States and have been able to negotiate some terrific shipping rates. We even offer free shipping with minimum order size. Contact us for details.
If youd like to request samples, please fill out the form on the right.
Its true that 99% of roasters buy coffee through brokers and have access to more-or-less the same coffee. However, our model is quite different. We arent satisfied with merely finding great coffee. We play an active role in helping producers improve quality over time. Just call us the 1%.
Thats a fantastic question. To answer it, its important to first define what local means. Coffee only grows in the tropics, so although we are fiercely local in many aspects, the very nature of importing coffee is that it is a part of the global marketplace.
Ever since we started roasting and sourcing, our business model is to work directly on the ground with coffee producers to evolve quality collaboratively. So by ordering coffee from us, you are, in fact, getting just about as close to the source of coffee as possible!
Yes. We have a full service office program that can cater to offices of all sizes. Please contact us, we can help!

We had the pleasure of serving coffee at the @hushandproper popup dinner at @gypsyapplebistro last night! 
Heres a shot of the show stopping course: 
Buttermilk Fried Quail with local root vegetables, parsnip pure, and duck gravy. 
Huge thank you to the Hush and Proper crew and @chefwescott for throwing down such a decadent feast!
Thank you @treehousebrewco for brewing such impeccable beers! It is inspiring to have a brewery nearby that has such an aligned vision when it comes to freshness and quality.  How they get IPAs to taste like washed Ethiopian coffees is totally beyond us.  (at Share Coffee)
Our friends Flame N Peach & the Liberated Waffles are folk'n it up at @nohowintermarket and were keeping them caffeinated on #sharecoffee!
Stop by for a free cup of drip if you purchase one of their CDs! (at Northampton Winter Farmers Market)
We will be closed tomorrow and Friday to spend some time with our respective families.
Dropping batches and back to normal hours on Monday the 30th.
We are in good company at The Dirty Truth! Our Costa Rica El Laurel is crushing it on Fetco, singing with notes of lemon meringue, sugar cane, and chocolate covered cherries. 
Roasters Choice: Pair it with their house cured corned beef hash benny & @alpinebeercos Nelson IPA.
Our name is a nod to the vast array of amazing farms we are surrounded by, many of whom participate in the CSA model (Community Supported Agriculture), which enables customers to buy a weekly farm share of produce.
We ship our coffee through the United States Postal Service. Based on your location, we use either First-Class or Priority Mail.

We believe so strongly in the power of super-fresh coffee that we only deliver to you weekly what you will drink in 4 to 10 days. If we sent you enough coffee for two weeks--or even worse an entire month--it would begin to lose it's vibrancy before you could finish half of it.
          Think of it like this: You'd never buy a month's worth of farmstand veggies at a single time. Likewise, we can't let you drink stale coffee. You can easily change the amount we deliver weekly from your dashboard.

Of course you can, anytime. You won't be billed or sent coffee until you resume your account.

          But why not share it with a friend? The same way you would with your weekly farm share if you were out of town, or abstaining from vegetables for a week. Just add a new shipping address for that week's coffee delivery.

Coffee is a crop, and crop cycles vary around the world. We are committed to bringing you coffee from the most recent and freshest harvest. We'll always try to match the flavor profile of the coffee type (Comfort or Adventure) you've chosen, but you can easily switch it to another available offering from your dashboard.

Our bags are adorable, and functional. We use the 6 ounce bag for two very important reasons:
Freshness. Once your super fresh coffee is exposed to air its special flavors and aromas begin to decline. By not opening that second or third bag until you need it, you keep that coffee at its freshest.
Variety. The smaller bags give you the flexibility to try more coffees.

All of our coffee is purchased through transparent and quality-driven specialty coffee importers. While we do not adhere to purchasing fair trade," all of our offerings are fairly traded. We always pay 2 to 3 times the fair trade price, often substantially more.

We consciously source our coffee based on cup quality, environmental stewardship, and traceability. Some of the coffee we purchase is organically certified, but not all of it. Similar to vegetable farmers in the US, coffee growers cannot call their product organic without paying the certification fee. Depending on the size of the cooperative/farm, this may not be a feasible expenditure.

This is our way of differentiating the taste profile of our customers' favorite coffees. Comfort is smooth and creamy while Adventure is juicy and vibrant. On our Coffees page, you can read more about the individual flavors found in each type we offer. And of course, you can easily change which bags you receive from week to week to try them all.

Wed like to keep you in the loop about some goings-on here at Stumptown. 
We dont know why or by whom coffee seeds were first roasted but we think it was a really good idea.
The theorems of how people came to roast coffee are shrouded in lore. Legend has it that 9th century goat herds in Ethiopia were seen eating unknown red berries and soon after were allegedly seen to be dancing naturally, their trusty shepherds followed suit.
Down the line, this coffee cherry was named diabolical by monks, thrown into the fire, and the fumes emitted therein were deemed divine. The only thing we can confirm is the nature of that holy roasted coffee bean.
Throughout history, people have roasted coffee beans over fires and in stoves. Later arrived the inventions of larger batch roasters and many of the machines built in the early twentieth century are the grandpaps of what we use now  in fact, most of the Probat roasters we use in our roasteries today were built mid-century. We currently have seven Probat drum roasters. Working with these old guys is like using a seasoned and well-loved cast iron skillet.
The roasting process is essentially a chemical decomposition of green coffee beans by heating. Things are both lost and created while roasting coffee. A green coffee bean changes as it is heated in many ways, but three of these changes are common in kitchens everywhere. They are known as Maillard reactions, Strecker Degradations and Caramelization  we have these guys to thank for roasted coffees aroma, flavor, sweetness and rich brown color. 
The Maillard is a browning reaction  its what makes toast taste different than stale bread. Caramelization is the breakdown of sugar molecules under high heat, which unearths an array of sweet, bitter and nutty flavor molecules. These processes change starch into sugars and then caramelize those sugars.
Very broadly speaking, at Stumptown, we tend to roast coffees at a medium roast. The whole truth is that we source really high quality coffees and roast each coffee just enough to bring out the best and full potential of whats inherent in each particular coffee already. Through roasting, we aim to draw out things like acidity, floral notes, chocolate, molasses, and earth.
All of the coffees flavor potentials are presented at the first crack  an audible signal that happens at a particular point when roasting coffee. After that, were roasting enough to add the right amount of body and sweetness, without degradation.
In other words, the goal is to bring out the best acidity, flavor and sweetness in each coffee thats brought to the surface through roasting, without tasting what weve done to it. If you continue to roast past that point, youll begin to taste the roast. Now some people love that roasty flavor,  and for you fine people, we make our French Roast. You can still taste some of the lovely inherent qualities of the coffee but you also are tasting the actual roast.
We dont have a roasting approach in general, as much as a general guiding principle in which all the coffees potential is revealed to you with nothing standing in the way,  says Jim Kelso, head of Quality Assurance in our Roasting Department. We want to honor the coffee producers. We dont think what weve done on a machine is more important than what theyve done to grow and process this coffee.
As always, were here to help! Ask your cafe barista, give us a shout at info@stumptowncoffee.com, or tweet us @stumptowncoffee for more specific roasting questions.
When people ask us about better brewing tips, getting the grind right is always at the top of our suggestion list. With that, we present to you a slew of tips and tricks to help you master the daily grind.
Freshly ground coffee is unparalleled. The minute you grind your coffee it starts to oxidize and accelerate the aging process. Grind it within 15 minutes before you brew for the best results.
In general, burr grinders are better than blade grinders. Blade grinders unevenly chop and shatter coffee beans, while burr grinders give you a more even grind which allows, in turn, for a better, more balanced brew. Having a larger range of particle sizes will lead to flavor of both under- AND over-extraction. In a pinch, blade grinders work best if you give them a little cocktail shaker shimmy when grinding. But burr is best.
Grind size affects the surface area of coffee that is exposed to water  we use the term extraction to describe this. Smaller particles will have more contact with water, and thus extract more quickly. The reverse is true, too. Basically, if you extract too much from the coffee (grind too fine or brew too long), the coffee may taste bitter and chalky, like aspirin. Extract too little (grind too coarse or too little brew time) and youll get sour flavors of vinegar with a lack of depth.
We offer grind suggestions in our brew guides as a starting point  so when we say, the grind for your Chemex should be about as coarse as Kosher salt, thats a good guide but may need some adjusting in grind and/or dose.  If you find your coffee is tasting too strong or bitter you may need to coarsen your grind or lower your dose. If its too weak, or watery, you might tighten your grind or increase your dose. Experiment away, and find what suits you best.
To start, we stand behind all of the equipment we sell in our shop and weve tried, tested and approved all of our grinders. That being said, there are pros and cons to both manual and electric grinders.
Hand grinders are a favorite around here because we are a bunch of rambling men and women. They are compact, durable and portable  great for camping or travel. But these babies are not for the feint of heart. They are a bit cheaper but what you save in money you spend in muscle and time. If youre making coffee for a crowd or are a morning grump, do yourself a favor and go electric.
We carry Baratza electric grinders because of their quality, consistency and solid customer support track record  the grinders are repairable and Baratza stocks all replacement parts. (Grinders, like all mechanical things, will eventually need upkeep and/or replacement parts.) Baratza even offers a grinder repair program which allows you to refurbish your grinder for a flat fee if you dont want to do the work yourself. Click here for a breakdown of the Baratza grinder models.

Independence Day is around the corner so weve asked some of our favorite Portland chefs to share coffee-inspired recipes to fire up our grill game on Americas birthday.
Executive Chef Andrew Gregory of The Woodsman Tavern mixed us up a Cold Brew Brine, a sweet & savory long game marinade, perfect for fish or chicken.
Chef Andrew Gregory, The Woodsman Tavern
NOTE: If you dont have Cold Brew, use 5 cups of water and 1 1/2 cups coarsely ground coffee beans to replace the Cold Brew and water in the recipe.
Combine all ingredients and heat just enough to dissolve the salt and sugar. Do not overheat or boil as this will change the flavor of the coffee and may make it bitter.
The salmon is brined for 24 hours. You could do less, but I recommend 24. For chicken, I would recommend 24-48 Hours. This would work with beef and pork, as well.
Remove the salmon from brine and pat dry. Lightly season with salt, and grill, bake, or sear in a pan. For the salmon, shoot for an internal temperature of 140 F for medium, or until the fish is slightly firm to the touch.  
Gregory made the accompanying salad with seasonal produce  cherry, cucumber, snap pea, basil, scallion and sherry vinaigrette. All of the vegetables are raw and cut into bite-sized pieces. Toss with olive oil, sherry vinegar, lemon juice, salt and black pepper.
Executive Chef Joshua McFadden of Ava Genes pulls off a fresh & cool grand finale that highlights the best produce of the season.
This is a very simple spring or summertime dessert. Granita is a Sicilian shaved ice  you can really apply this idea to any liquid you can freeze. Use an assortment of seasonal berries, stone fruits, or melons. If you cant find fresh local fruit, you could use dried fruit steeped in water, fruit juice or coffee. If fresh fruit is out of season, dont use fruit. Substitute with anything seasonal that sounds good to you  you could also use nuts or cake.*
Crack the coffee in between a sheet of parchment with the back of a pan. Put coffee, cream, sugar and salt in a pan.  Bring to a simmer. Pull off heat, let cool to room temperature and refrigerate overnight. The next day, strain, and whip to medium peaks.
Pour cold brew into a shallow metal pan and place in the freezer. As it begins to freeze, use a fork to scrape it into coarse frozen, separated crystals. Occasional agitation helps to create the best results. Once it has reached a frozen Superman ice cave consistency, you can cover it up and keep it in the freezer. Before you use it, scrape it again.
Combine Hair Bender coffee cream and seasonal berries and top with Cold Brew Granita.
Whiskey and Coca-Cola are as American as apple pie. We invite ourselves to the party and add Cold Brew to keep everyone shimmying post-BBQ food coma.

Stir together the whiskey, Coke and Cold Brew with ice. Strain into a glass, and serve over ice.
The holidays are just around the corner so we thought wed share some tips on how best to brew for a crew of guests. 
A lot of us here make our daily coffee through single cup pour overs like the Bee House and Chemex at home, which can be tricky when brewing for a crowd. Here are some helpful hints to you keep you going strong through to the requisite pie course.
French press pots come in different sizes. We like the Bodum, which we sell in a 3-cup, 8-cup and 12-cup in our online shop. See our best brewing practices in our brew guide. Just remember when using a press pot, its crucial to pour the coffee out of the press after your 4 minute brew is complete or the coffee will keep extracting and youll end up with coffee you can chew. And thats a gift to no one.
These are great options for a smaller crowd, and if you have the time and free hands. You can always brew a couple of Chemex pots and pour them into a carafe that will keep your coffee hot. For a 20 ounce brew, we use 42 grams of coffee (about 6 level Tablespoons.) 
We have kind of a love affair with the Bonavita Thermal Carafe brewer. It heats the water to the ideal brewing temperature of around 200 degrees, allows for a bloom with its shower-like water spray, and shuts off so your coffee isnt continuously heating on the heating plate. But wait, theres more! The insulated carafe keeps your coffee hot for hours. We like like this brewer.
If you do have an electric coffee brewer with a heating plate, we recommend that you turn it off or remove the coffee from the heat so as to avoid the old cooked gas station coffee situation.
Preheat your serving cups and mugs with hot water to keep your coffee from cooling down too quickly.
Pour your French press or Chemex brewed coffee into a thermos. For your best bet, dont keep the coffee in your thermos or carafe for more than an hour, especially when brewing French press.
Our Ethiopia Mordecofe is a prime time dessert coffee  its clean tea-like qualities cut the sweetness of pumpkin and fruit pies.
Guatemala Finca El Injerto Pacamaras intensity of flavor, complexity and acidity balance rich and heavy holiday menus. Its the Champagne of our holiday coffees!
Costa Rica Montes De Oro is an ideal house guest for a gingerbread cottage.
The Colombia  El Jordan has delicate bright notes that go along with any menu. It has a great long finish and distinct chocolate notes. A definite crowd pleaser!
Hair Bender is a bang up cure for a bender. Make it your New Years hangover helper.
As always, weve got your back. Feel free to holler at us at info@stumptowncoffee.com or tweet us @stumptowncoffee for brewing tips or suggested coffee pairings.
These guides serve as a good place to start. The grinder you use, coffee you choose, and yes, even the water from your sink, can alter the taste in the cup. Every machine is different, so youll want to think of these parameters more as guidelines than law. Play around with your brewer and parameters to get each coffee to taste just how you like it.
Invented by engineer Alan Adler, of Aerobie Frisbee fame, the AeroPress has, fittingly, inspired crazy ingenuity in variety of brew methods. The portable and lightweight AeroPress brews a sweet, full-bodied cup wherever you are: at home, camping or on a road trip. This particular method is best when youre out in the field or if you dont have a scale.
Measure and grind 17g of coffee  one rounded AeroPress spoonful or about 2  Tablespoons. Grind the coffee about as fine as table salt.

Get the AeroPress ready to brew by placing the filter in the basket. Next, preheat the brewer and rinse the filter with hot water. This gets rid of any paper flavor and warms everything up. Heat up your mug with hot water while youre at it.

Discard the rinse water from your mug. Affix the basket to the bottom of the brew chamber and place it on top of the mug. If its handy, use the funnel (or coffee loader) that comes with the AeroPress to add 17g of coffee. Then, remove the funnel. 

Start your timer when you pour hot water (just off the boil or about 205F) into your brewer. Saturate all the grounds within 10 seconds. Pour to the No. 4 or 220g of water if youre using a scale. Spin the chamber, making sure all the coffee is saturated. 

Once you hit the No. 4, stir the slurry (coffee and water mixture) and place the plunger on the brew chamber and pull up slightly to create a pressure seal. Dont plunge yet! 

At 1:15, remove the pressure seal and give the slurry another stir with a spoon or paddle. 
Put the plunger back on and gently press down with steady pressure, stopping as soon as you hear a hissing sound. This entire brew process should take just under two minutes and yield seven to eight ounces of coffee. 

The AeroPress is easy to clean. Simply take off the basket and pop out the coffee grounds and filter. Clean the rubber plunger with hot kettle water and youre ready for your next brew.

A sleek and simple daily pour over, the Bee House is a favorite around here for its ease of use, and clean, sweet cup character. Its a Japanese update on a classic paper cone brewer. Melitta Bentz invented the first version of this brewer in 1908, using her sons blotting paper and a punctured brass pot. Today, you can find Melitta filters just about everywhere.
Measure 21g or (about 3 Tablespoons) of coffee beans. Grind them to medium fine or about as fine as table salt. 

Fold a Melitta #4 filter down the scalloped edges. Insert it into the Bee House Brewer and place it on top of your mug or pitcher. Pre-rinse the filter with hot water to rinse out the paper flavor and preheat your brewer and mug. Make sure to chuck this rinse water before you begin brewing. Add the ground coffee to the filter and zero out the scale.

Start the timer once you add hot water. Saturate the grounds, then give them a stir to break up the clumps. Coffee degasses or  blooms when its fresh  the coffee bed should rise up  and bubble up a bit. 

Pour the water evenly in a spiral over the coffee bed and slowly fill the brewer to the top. Pour over the dark spots and avoid the light ones as you bring the weight up to about 380g by 1:00.

Once you hit 2:00, your mug should be almost full (or you should have about 10 oz of brewed coffee). If there is still water in left in the brewer at this time, dont sweat it. Remove the dripper from atop the mug and place it in the sink. 

An iconic brewer with a timeless design invented in 1941, the Chemex is easy to use and easy on the eyes. The Chemex is housed in the MOMA permanent design collection it also lives on most of our kitchen counters, too. It  brews a clean cup and maintains body and balanced floral notes.
Place the Chemex Filter in the brewer with single fold away from the spout and multiple folds lined up against the spout. Rinse the filter with hot water to get a nice even seal all the way around. This preheats the brewer and gets rid of any paper flavor from the filter. Dump the rinse water and fold the filter toward the spout to reinforce this area.
Add 42g or about 6 Tablespoons of coffee ground kind of like Kosher salt. Center the coffee in your brewer and zero out the scale.
Start the timer when you add the hot water. Pour until all the grounds are saturated or until you reach about 150g. Stir with a chopstick or spoon to make sure there are no dry clumps.
At :45, start the second pour, making sure to reintegrate the coffee and water. Pour with a wiggling motion, then a gentle spiral until the volume reaches about a fingertip down from the top of the rim or 450g of water. Pour over the dark spots and avoid the light ones.
At 1:45, fill the brewer flush to the top or about 700g of water.
At 4:00, you should be pretty close to volume. Look at the glass bubble or belly button, which indicates 20 ounces. Lift the filter. Its okay to hover for a couple of seconds to make sure you have enough volume. Then pull the filter out completely and let it drain into the sink.
Swirl the Chemex around a little and youre ready to serve two cups of brewed coffee. 
Theres nothing better than cold brewed coffee on a hot summer day  or if youre like us, any day, really. Cold Brew coffee is naturally smooth and sweet and less acidic than coffee brewed with hot water. The Filtron Cold Water Brewer is a simple way to make several cups  of cold brew concentrate. Cold brewing takes between 12  24 hours (we recommend 16) but the payoff is huge. This batch should keep you buzzing for days. We recommend a ratio of 1:2 coffee concentrate to water over ice, adjusting to taste.
Take the rubber stopper and plug the hole at the bottom of the coffee bowl.
Take the Filtron pad and fit it snugly in the bottom of the coffee bowl. It should be domed up in the center when its in place correctly.  If you are using it for the first time, give it a good rinse. When not using the pad, be sure to store it in cold water in the fridge.
Measure 12 ounces or  lb of coffee. Your coffee should be ground coarsely to  about the consistency of breadcrumbs. Pour it directly into the coffee bowl and  give it a shake to even out the coffee bed.
Place the coffee guard right on top of the coffee grounds. This will help the water distribute evenly and keep the coffee bed flat during brewing.
Add 56 ounces of cold water for 12 ounces ( lb) of coffee. Fill to the the  lb line inside the Filtron water bowl. If youre filling it over the sink, cover the hole at the bottom with your finger so the water doesnt drain out. Or, just add water directly to the water bowl.
After you pour the water in, let it brew for 12 to 24 hours. We recommend 16. Store it in your refrigerator.
After 16 hours, the concentrate should be ready. Use the handle of the coffee bowl and lift it above the empty 1 1/2 liter decanter. Pull out the stopper slowly over the decanter and set it on top to drain. This should take about 30 to 45 minutes and will make several cups of concentrate.
Pour over ice. We suggest a ratio thats one part concentrate to two parts water. Adjust to your taste. The concentrate will keep in your refrigerator for about 10 days. Beware! Cold Brew coffee goes down smooth and easy, but packs a potent punch. Sip slowly, or add lots of ice, water, or milk to keep you from flying too close to the sun.
Easy to brew and super consistent, the French Press is very reliable. Its classic and well-engineered design hasnt changed much since its invention in 1929, and its perfect for making multiple cups of heavy-bodied coffee in 4 minutes.
Warm up your empty French Press by rinsing it with very hot water. This helps maintain the temperature while brewing for best extraction.  

Measure out 56g (about 8 Tablespoons)  of coffee and grind it as coarse as breadcrumbs.

Now that your French Press is warmed up, discard the hot water and add coffee into the empty press. Start your count-up timer as soon as you add hot water. Fill it up halfway to the top saturating all  the grounds, making sure that there are no dry spots. 

At 1:00, use a wooden spoon or spatula to break the top layer we call the crust. We prefer to use wood and not metal so you dont accidentally crack the glass. Give it a good stir.

Now, fill it all the way to the top with water. Put the top on and allow the coffee to brew without pressing it down.

At 4:00, you are ready to press. Firmly push the press all the way down. 

Serve it up. Pour coffee into a carafe immediately to avoid over extraction. If the coffee sits on the grounds too long, it continues to extract and will become bitter.  To clean the French Press, we find it easiest to add a little water to the grounds, give it a good swirl, and empty into the trash or compost bin. 

With its stainless steel and wavy contours, the Kalita Wave wins over coffee and design enthusiasts alike. Its a favorite pour over brew method for home use and its great on the go, too. The flat-bottom filter helps with even extraction while brewing.  The key to mastering this brewer is the slow spiral pour. 
Place and rinse the Kalita Wave filter in the dripper. This removes the paper flavor from the filter and warms everything up. Heat up your mug while youre at it.  

Discard the rinse water from the carafe or mug and grind 21g (about 3 Tablespoons) of coffee as fine as table salt. Add it to the filter, making sure the bed is completely flat. Place the Kalita Wave on top of a carafe or mug. Tare your scale to zero.

Saturate the dry grounds completely with 60g of hot water right off the boil (about 205F) in the first 10 seconds and allow it to bloom. Coffee degasses or blooms when its freshthe coffee bed should rise up and bubble a bit. Give the coffee a stir with a spoon. 

At :45, pour water up to 200g in a spiral motion by 1:00. The spiral motion helps give you an even extraction and keeps everything integrated.

Pour small amounts (25-50g of water) periodically to hit 375g by 2:00. Submerging dark spots and avoiding light spots, slowly bring the water level to the top for an even extraction. 

Your brew volume should reach approximately 300ml or about to the top of a 10oz mug  at 2:45 to 3:00. Remove the Wave from the carafe or mug and set it in the sink for the rest of the water to drain through. 

Nuanced and versatile, the Hario is an elegant brewer for those who want to perfect the pour. Its great for folks who are looking for complete control over brewing extraction. The key here is to pour slow. The entire brew process for a 10oz mug takes about three minutes. 
Fold the filter into a cone shape and rinse it in the Hario dripper with water just off the boil (about 205F) to eliminate paper flavor and to heat up the mug or carafe you are brewing into. Discard the rinse water.

Grind 21 grams (about 3 Tablespoons) of coffee to be about as fine as kosher salt. Add coffee to your brewer.

Saturate the grounds with water right off the boil (about 205F). Use just enough water to cover the grounds. Let it bloom for 15 seconds. Coffee de-gasses or blooms when its freshthe coffee bed should raise up and bubble a bit. 

Pour water in a slow, even spiral, adding water every 10  15 seconds for an even extraction. Pour over the dark spots and avoid the light ones. If you're using a scale, you should pour until you reach 360 g. 

Once you hit 3:00, you should have about 10 oz of brewed coffee.  Remove the brewer and pour the coffee into a warm mug. 
We start with the highest quality coffee, cold brew it without heat for over 12 hours, then use a double filtration process to procure the end result: a complex, smooth and full-bodied brew with low-acid and a chocolate finish. Feelings of invincibility and euphoria are likely tofollow.

      Every Stumptown employee is a steward of that single coffee cherry, from the time it gets picked until the time it ends up in your cup. Stumptown is an energy and a vibe and a culture, but it all ultimately revolves around amazing, incredible coffee.

We work hard. We make lots of jokes. We cheers beers, ride bikes together, go to shows and trade dogsitting favors. We have tremendous amounts of respect for each other and for what we do. Stumptown is a family on an elemental level. Many of us are artists, musicians, creative types, and passionate types. It helps our coffee taste better and it makes our work lives richer.
And we drink the best office coffee on the planet.  
Some of us came because we were regulars. The baristas knew our drinks and were having a whole helluva lot more fun than the jobs we had. Some came because of the coffee. Some of us were home roasters, or worked for other coffee companies across the country. Came for a chance to work with the best green coffee in the world.
Some came because our best friends worked here. Most became best friends with our coworkers, because they also happened to be some of the best, most interesting people around.
We all came because we wanted to be here. A grip of us have been here for over a decade. Weve outgrown our first employee holiday dinners, squeezed in the backroom of a cozy Italian family restaurant in Southeast Portland. Weve leapt across the country. Went Dutch for a summer. But our holiday parties still rage.
We are passionate group of folks, some might even say obsessive. No matter which team were on, were sourcing, roasting, tasting, testing, practicing and pushing ourselves to do it better.

          We know we are the last link of a long chain, stretching across the earth, made up of hundreds of people and years of toil, soil and sweat to get this coffee into our hands. We take that responsibility very seriously. And we also have a lot of fun.
        

Stumptown runs on creative energy (and coffee, obviously) and the Creative and Marketing team helps us wrangle it. Our in-house team is responsible for everything from illustrations on mugs and packaging design, to signage, communications, and throwing rad events with our friends and partners. If you ever see weird drawings, gifs, or photoshopped snaps of Ozzy Osbourne holding a Cold Brew stubbie, thats all them.

        Coffee is about pleasure. Its that moment when your hand is warmed by the mug, you bring it up to your nose, inhale deeply and then take a sip.
      

        That sip is the culmination of years of work, three-thousand mile journeys, and passion. Here is how we make that sip perfect.
      

        While you are holding that cup of coffee, close your eyes. Open your mouth slightly. Breathe in deeply through your nose.
      

        You are smelling the most complex thing humans consume. When people talk about the flavors of coffee  notes of orange, or hints of clove  its because those organic molecules are contained in the coffee bean. If a coffee reminds you of apple pie, it's because coffee shares some of the same components as food, like lactic and malic acid.
      

        Inside that small bean are the same natural components that make flowers smell so lovely, the same ethers that let you know when a piece of fruit is ripe. Coffee has twice as much going on, molecularly speaking, as red wine.
      

        When tasting coffee, try waiting for it to cool down a little  youll be able to taste (and smell) the most when its the same temperature as your body.
      

        Flavor only matters in the context of you. What do you like? What does this scent remind you of? Are you looking for a full-bodied cowboy co
        ffee, or a delicate, tea-like finish? Chocolate aromas, or hints of jasmine?

        Dont worry if you cant describe it precisely, or have a different perception than someone else. Even when you cant put it into words, youll know what you like.
      

        You experience the full flavors of the coffee bean if and only if nothing has gone wrong during
      

        There is one right way to roast coffee.
      

        Someone stands by that roaster, all day, a person who knows exactly how to bring the best out of every bean  that ideal ratio of sweetness to acidity, that balance  because he or she has been doing this for years.
      

        Again and again, they repeat the same motion: pull a tiny sample of the beans. Stare at them, looking for the tiny signs of perfection. Smell them deeply. Put them back. Pull out some more beans. Stare. Smell. Five seconds later, repeat the process in a meditation that last hours. Do that hundreds of times a day. Do that every day for years.
      

        Know every bean on a personal level. Adjust times and temperatures throughout the day, knowing that 15 seconds could make the difference between letting this bean shine and overwhelming it. Know that in the morning, the roaster is cold. Know that in the evening its hot, and you should probably shave 45 seconds off that roast.
      

        Roast just enough to bring out the best and full potential of whats inherent in each particular coffee already. Roast to draw out things like acidity, floral notes, chocolate, molasses, and earth. All of the coffees flavor potentials are presented at the first crack  an audible signal that happens at a particular point when roasting coffee. After that, roast just enough to add the right amount of body and sweetness, without degradation.
      

        Roasting different coffees as though theyre the same? Not going to work. Roasting for color, not taste? Never this.
      

        Please dont burn those beans. Theyve been through so much. Theyve come all the way across the world.
      

        The best coffee grows in the most remote places. There is a thin band that goes around the world near the equator. Within that band, you need mountains, thick old-growth forest and just the right microclimate. Set aside up to four days to get there.
      

        On your way there, youll pass through Houstons H.W. Bush Intercontinental Airport, or youll stand in the endless security line at New Yorks JFK en route to distant parts of Ethiopia, Colombia, Indonesia and 10 other countries around the world.
      

        Youll also experience 8 vaccines (the malaria pillswhich can cause hallucinations and nightmaresare the worst), a passport that fills up with handwritten visas, bumpy eight-hour van rides, granola bars and in at least one case, eating the heart of a bull that has been slaughtered in your honor.
      

        The Green Team members, named for the color of coffee beans before they are roasted, dont do it the easy way, which would be buying bulk, mid-quality beans at a trading floor in a capital city. Instead, they go right to the source of the best coffee  that farm or washing station high atop a distant Ethiopian hill. It ends when they arrive at that distant farm, washing station, factory or mill. They sit down in a home or around a campfire to talk about this years crop with a producer they have met many times. They get to work.
      

          In Colombia, if you go to four farms you will get four bowls of sanchocho, which is this soup with chicken, yucca, plantains, potatoes, corn, avocado. Basically, its as many calories as you can cram in a bowl.
        

        The Green Team visits every producer as often as possible, sometimes up to three times per year. They constantly roast and taste the coffee, and they form long-term, lasting partnerships with the producers. Theyll help them implement a new farming technique that could lead to even better coffee. Or theyll teach a seminar on a new way to process coffee cherry, which is the fruit of the coffee tree surrounding the seed or bean.
      

        They routinely pay producers up to four times what they could get for their crop on the commodity market, but in return, they ask for a lot more workhand picking each cherry at ideal ripeness, or implementing a new piece of equipment.
      

        The Green Team also identifies potential future producersmaybe this side of the mountain has just the right climate, but the quality level isnt there yet. Stumptown will invest in that farm, or mill, or factory if that producer is willing put forth effort to get the beans to the level the Green Team looks for. Its a partnership, and there is prestige and pride involved. For a producer, selling to Stumptown means something.
      

        Above all, they want to help farms become sustainable and to set up strong businesses that build up their communities and produce the highest-quality coffee possible year after year.
      

          Our partners are much more than farmers, they are coffee production experts, constantly innovating practices in planting, harvesting and processing the best coffees around.
        

        We dont buy in bulk on a trading floor. We buy directly from the people who are making the coffee. Its not a transaction; its a partnership. If someone is growing the quality of coffee were interested in, then we will help them in any way we can. That means regular visits (even though that trip can take up to four days), implementing new techniques and equipment, and forming long-term partnerships.
      

        We shoot for sustainability, and not just in the environmental sense. A sustainable coffee producer is someone who is paid fairly for their incredible work and who can in turn encourage others to follow in their footsteps. A sustainable producer innovates, develops and improves cultivation and in turn can fetch even higher prices from Stumptown. The more each side of the partnership puts in, the better the coffee gets.
      

        We dont call them farmers, we call them producers, which gives credit to the fact that they are production experts. They are the ones who make this coffee great. They are the ones who are like-minded, who will go the extra mile for quality, whatever that means.

          Producers are the heart of what makes great coffee.
        

          Their skills, expertise and craftsmanship is the difference between mediocre coffee and coffee that is like nothing youve ever tasted before. The coffee will never get any better in quality once it lands in our hands, after all. We rely on the producers for that pristine bean. A good roaster works tirelessly to preserve that coffees inherent greatness.
        

          The producers grow the coffee trees. They pick the cherry when it is perfectly ripe. They remove the outer fruit, leaving just the bean covered in a thin parchment. They rest the beans, let the beans develop into their full selves.
        

          (This is a ridiculous oversimplification of a meticulous, finicky process. For more on how coffee processing  the transition from tree to bean  works)
        

          Everyone on this page does something slightly different  he may tend a small patch of coffee trees on the farm he inherited from his grandmother; she may oversee the cherry soaking in a big tank of water, fermenting at just the right rate.
        

          They live on four continents. They speak at least 30 different languages. Some use traditional methods that are centuries old; some have taken out four-year loans to get that new top-of-the-line piece of equipment that will lead to a greater, cleaner cup.
        

          Its not the easy way. Its not the fast way. Its the right way, and it creates the best coffee possible.
        

        Coffee is a tree, and you probably prefer one branch to another, even if you don't know it yet.
      

        There isnt one kind of coffee, theres a coffee family tree. For hundreds of years, humans have been cultivating, hybridizing and perfecting it, and today there are hundreds of types, or varieties.
      

        There are hundreds of varieties, and weve chosen roughly a dozen that we find truly special. But here are the first ones you should know.
      

          So sweet, so complex and so delicate, this is the pinot noir of coffee. The plants are fragile and dont produce as much cherry as some other varieties, but theyre worth the effort. A cup of Bourbon-type variety is lush and classic. Its the coffee of coffee. It charms the snob and the rookie alike. And no, it has nothing to do with the delicious brown adult beverage, though we at Stumptown are big fans of that kind of bourbon, too.

          This is an offshoot of of the Typica family, which is delicate, floral, at times even citrusy. This variety was brought to Indonesia in the late 1600s by Dutch traders. We love it for its nuances and high, fine acidity. Villalobos in particular brings strong flavors of stone fruits like apricots, peaches and plums.
        

          The beauty of these is in their mystery. They are the wildflower varieties, descended from the natural coffee forests of southwestern Ethiopia. Each village has its own variety, handed down over centuries and shaped by the soil, elevation and weather.
        

Related: All of them, really but these in particular: Typica, Gesha


          Think of Gesha as coffee from an alternate dimension. It's like a Szechuan peppercorn, or the Sun Ra Arkestra, complex and otherworldly. Its as far as it could be from diner coffee, a delicate, black-tea body, with a zest of bergamot. Gesha is pickyit will only grow when, where and how it wants, in tiny microclimates. But whether you grow it in Indonesia or the Americas, it is always thoroughly itself.
        

Related: Nothing. Its in its own orbit.
        

        Which, finally, brings us to the very beginnings of coffee
      

        Ten thousand years ago, the Coffea trees grew wild and tangly on the mountain slopes of southwestern Ethiopia.
      

        There, you can still find people performing traditional coffee ceremonies many times a dayone woman will prepare it for the circle of her friends and family who stand around her. She roasts it in a pan, grinds it, pours hot water over it, serves it in the predetermined social order.
      

        The Dutch traders, enamored of this tradition, brought cuttings of the plants to Indonesia. French missionaries, who also saw the beauty in this hot, euphoric brew, spread it throughout Africa and across the sea to the Americas.
      

        Today, coffee trees are cultivated in every hemisphere on four continents. In 70 countries, you will find those shrubs and their cherry. Youll also find find the farmers who tend them, the pickers who select them, the processors who obsessively convert fruit to bean. Youll find the roasters who delicately transform them, and youll find the coffee drinkers.
      

        Youll find the earliest riser in the backpacking crew that stokes the fire and sets the water on to boil. Youll find the barista who pulls the first shot of the morning for the go-getter. Youll find the group of 70-year-old men in the diner at 6 a.m., spending hours discussing the issues of the day over their bottomless cups.
      

          Drinking coffee is a pleasure. Coffee drinking is fun, and it feels good, and every once in awhile I remember that were actually cultivating pleasure. Why do you put anything in your mouth? Because its delicious.
        

        Everything that came beforethe shrubs, the farmer, the journey across the sea, the hybrids and the mutationsis for this moment. Because the only thing required for the smallest, quietest and most personal of coffee ceremonies are some good beans and a way to brew.
      

        Youll hold that mug possessively. Youll inhale deeply. And then you drink.

This father and son team grows, processes and educates at the best coffee-
growing operation in Guatemala and one of the top five in the world.
The Aguirres have opened their own roastery and coffee bar in Guatemala City to 
 showcase their coffee and train baristas.
The Aguirres set the bar in the world of coffee.
We could talk for hours about what theyve done for their community  building 
schools, clinics, safe worker housing, a tortilla factory to make sure everyone is fed, a 
microhydropower plant that powers not only the farm but the nearby village.
Year after year, we come to them for their impeccably balanced, complex coffee that 
hits on every level.
El Injerto is a seven-hour drive from Guatemala City, a bumpy, curvy van ride up over the mountains and down into a lush canyon. From the farm, you can see the Sierra Madre de Chiapas mountain range in Mexico.
From the seasonal pickers all the way up to Arturo Sr., everyone at El Injerto is focused on obsessively making the best coffee possible. 
Every day, they cup with their entire processing team, many of whom used to be pickers and have worked their way up through the organization. Theyll have mini-competitions with blind taste tests so see whos making the best coffee.
They also educate nearby farmers and the coffee world as a whole on sustainability, community engagement and the sense of what great coffee can be. Year after year, El Injerto wins Guatemalas Cup of Excellence award.
The relationship between Stumptown and Finca El Injerto is one of our strongest and longest. Arturo Aguirre, a 3rd generation coffee farmer, owns and operates the farm with his son, Arturo Jr. They run the farm with dedication to sustaining a coffee farming community and a meticulous approach to processing the highest quality coffee in Guatemala. The efforts of the Aguirre family, combined with our own, have improved the coffee year after year.
Mr. Jesus Aguirre Panama acquired the land in 1874 and planted corn, beans, tobacco, and sugarcane. Around 1900, he planted coffee and named the farm El Injerto after a native fruit that is similar to Zapote fruit and found only in this region. Three generations and over 100 years later, El Injerto has 245 hectares planted with coffee: 70% Bourbon, with the remaining mixed between Catuai, Maragogype, Pacamara, Tekisic, Mocca and Gesha varieties.
Arturo Jr. is working on some new projects which will greatly improve fermentation including building an additional fermentation tank, finishing tiling the entire washing area and tiling all of the tanks. Arturo Jr. conveys a huge sense of pride about their social programs. The family built new housing for their year round workers with the funds from their auction. Eight of the ten families received new homes. They built a new clinic, maintenance room and four newly installed showers and bathrooms for workers. The clinic has been a mainstay at El Injerto for years with a physician who visits every 15 days from the nearby town of La Democracia. They built a playground and nursery for the pickers kids, which will enable the pickers to have their children supervised and provide activities during harvest. Injerto also pays twice the hourly wage as their neighbors. An expectation of higher scrutiny in all things concerned with harvesting and processing comes with the higher wage. Some workers have found it too demanding, but this is what sets Injerto apart.
Since 1905, Finca El Injerto has produced exceptional coffee with a commitment to respecting and preserving the natural resources of the Huehuetenango region. More than half of Finca El Injerto is a thousand year old virgin forest that surrounds and protects the coffee plantation, preserving the delicate micro-climate required to grow exquisite Arabica coffee.
The Aguirres protect the quality of the land through sustainable agricultural methods. They use coffee parchment for fuel in the mechanical dryers. Water used in wet milling is filtered in ponds before returning to the rivers to avoid pollution downstream. Native species are replanted in reforestation efforts. They focus on the coffee plants tissue management system without the use of fungicides, herbicides or insecticides. They manage weeds strictly by machete. In order to assess the appropriate nutritional supplements for the plants, soil and leaf analysis takes place annually.  Worm culture technology breaks down the coffee cherry skin to produce lombricompost which becomes a fertilizer at the nursery and the final plantings. Shade trees are planted throughout the farm to promote air circulation and control the amount of sunlight received by the plants. El Injerto also has many social projects which promote the well-being and health of the workers and their families.
Arturo Sr. and Jr. ensure perfect cherry selection and utilize cherry flotation to sort by density. Disc depulpers remove the cherry prior to extended fermentation which can last up to 72 hours due to the cold typical of this altitude.  In 2013, they installed a pre-pulp separator to further minimize pulp contamination during fermentation. The coffee is then double washed and soaked. Patio pre-drying prepares the beans for a final low temperature drum drying. In order to better understand the coffee and all the nuances within their production, they have a cupping lab at the farm with four trained cuppers.
The Aguirres named the section of their farm where they cultivate Pacamara Pandoras Block. This block nourishes a sweet, balanced and floral variety. Pacamara, a hybrid of Pacas and Maragogype, creates a perfect marriage of Bourbon and Typica. Arturo Aguirre Sr. purchased their first Pacamara seeds from El Salvador where the variety originated. Pandoras Block consists of a mixture of old and new plants, averaging 18 years old. They renovate annually to maintain plant age diversity.
Three years ago, a hail storm swept through Huehuetenango and devastated half of the Aguirres Pacamara plants. The plants can take years to recover. Happily, this year, their production finally reached full volume.
After meticulously picking ripe cherry, they depulp it, dry ferment for 18-24 hours, and soak it for 24 hours in clean water. They dry this lot strictly on tiered raised beds.
Stumptown founder Duane Sorenson brought Gesha seeds to Arturo Aguirre Jr. years ago. Later in the same year, Arturo Sr. traveled to Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama and brought some more seeds directly from the Petersons. 
The Gesha seeds were planted in 2008 in a region of the farm with a high shade canopy called La Calaca. La Calaca translates as the skull. According to the people of the village, this area in the northwest part of the farm used to be where witches of the towns held rituals. They have even found animal skulls to offer as proof of their story. Seven different varieties are cultivated on the 12 hectare area of La Calaca. Workers on the farm believe they have transformed the rituals of those long ago witches into a good spell. They believe the coffee cultivated here will bewitch any who dares to drink it.
The staff at El Injerto is learning about the nuances of Gesha by constantly checking the crop throughout the growing season to see how it behaves and reacts within the microclimate in order to make important decisions about the tissue management. Each variety reacts differently from climate to climate, so it takes education, observation, and detailed management in order to perfect a particular variety.
The tiny lot of Gesha was treated with utmost care and detail. The Aguirres sent their finest pickers to select these cherry at the height of the harvest season. After depulping, this lot was dry fermented for 18-24 hours in perfectly clean conditions, moving the beans after each stage for uniform fermentation. The lot was then washed and soaked for 24 hours then dried on tiered, raised drying beds. They sorted this lot by hand twice, once during the parchment stage and then again just prior to export at the green bean stage. 
In 2014, the Aguirres built a micro hydroelectric power plant which provides electricity for the farm, mill and all of the housing (which includes workers housing). They purchased and distributed over 50 safer and more efficient gas cooking stoves to replace the less healthy wood stoves in their workers homes. They also continue to provide free food for all of their workers from their onsite tortilla factory. The Aguirre family plans to plant more Gesha. This year the Gesha dried on raised beds for the first time, rather than on patios.
The co-op supports its 630 members through education and sustainability initiatives in a very remote area near the Andes Mountain in Northern Peru. 
Typica, Bourbon, Caturra, Pache and Mundo Novo
Recently the cooperative made a big investment in a large compost plant called a Pachakushi, which is used to create organic compost that is distributed among co-op members.
La Prosperidad de Chirinos Cooperative supports its 630 members through education and sustainability initiatives, maintains model and learning gardens, a coffee nursery, and a guinea pig farm (a food staple here) as part of a food security program. Were really excited about the growth weve seen so far and looking very forward to a bright future for a long term partnership. 
Chirinos is located in a very remote and beautiful area in the Cajamarca Region in Northern Peru with breathtaking landscapes. When we travel here to meet our producer partners, travel is slow and bumpy. The coffee culture here is relatively young and the region is only just beginning to gain access to basic infrastructure, such as electricity and paved roads. Our last trip traveling through this region, we spent over 30 hours in the car. 
When come for a visit, our producers always offer upon arrival a shot of homemade aguardiente, anise-flavored firewater booze that the locals (and many producers we know) make and store in plastic Coca-Cola liters. For dinner, were served freshwater fish, wild hen, or cuy (guinea pig) and rice and yucca, served with Aji sauce.   
A cultural heritage and ethos of environmental awareness is embedded in the culture here, creating a mecca for organic coffee. Addressing the difficult issue of organic fertilization, Chirinos recently invested in a large compost plant and can now produce nutrient-rich organic compost that is distributed among members. Each producer primarily cultivates coffee on their small farms and brings it to Chirinos for processing. They depulp their coffee into wood or concrete tanks for fermentation and dry it on patios. 
Farming, processing and exporting classic Antiguan coffee
The family coffee business is over 100 years old
He is the cousin of Ricardo Zelaya
Among those who love Antiguan coffees, the Zelaya family is legendary. Luis represents the fourth generation of this tremendous legacy, and while he honors tradition, he also pushes Antiguan coffee toward the future. He constantly innovates and elevates quality levels, and is instrumental in making Antiguan Coffee a Protected Designation of Origin product, which places them alongside Champagne from the 45th parallel or prosciutto from southern Italy. Whenever he visits us in Portland, he always wants to stop by the Horse Brass Pub for a local microbrew.
Founded in 1527, Antigua is a regal place, having once been the capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala. It sits in the shadow of three volcanoes  including the very active Fuego Volcano. The last time we visited, Fuego was spewing plumes of ash and the lava was flowing  its that same volcanic ash that contributes to the incredible minerality of the soil, and in turn, the beautiful fruitiness of the coffee.
Luis is unique among our larger producers  he has taken coffee separation and made it a wonderfully meticulous art. He divides his coffee by farm, microclimate, location, date harvested and more  and keeps all of it separate through depulping, processing and drying. The result is an incredible variety of nuanced, distinct coffees with bright, sweet flavor.
Antigua, Guatemala is one of the most renowned coffee producing regions in the world due to its climate, altitude, fertile volcanic soils and farming practices. Antigua sits in a valley scattered with coffee farms surrounded by three volcanoes: Agua, Fuego and Acatenango.
Bella Vista is a farm, wet mill, and dry mill owned by the Zelaya family. With over 100 years of experience, the Zelaya family is committed to maintaining excellent quality coffee through ecologically stable and environmentally friendly methods.
Our Bella Vista consists of coffee from a combination of 100% Bourbon lots processed at Bella Vista, some grown by Zelaya himself and some grown by the Hunapu group.
Zelaya also instigated variety separation at Bella Vista farm, which fostered the ability for a lot consisting only of Villa Sarchi, a variety renown for sweetness and brightness. They improved their raised bed infrastructure by converting to three-tiered parabolic drying beds.
Hunapu, the local indigenous Cackchiquel word for the Volcano de Agua, is the name of a group of smallholder producers in the San Miguel Dueas and Ciudad Vieja microregions around Antigua who process their coffee at Bella Vista. Since 2006, Luis Pedro has worked with these farmers to develop meticulous lot separation with the ability to track lots from the farms, to the mill, to the warehouse and to their final destination. He brings his familys commitment to each family he works with for all the coffees milled at Bella Vista.
The Hunapu farmers deliver their red ripe coffee cherry to the Zelaya familys Bella Vista Mill to be processed and handled through export. Originally built in 1910, the mill had to be rebuilt after it was destroyed during the 1976 earthquake. This coffee is traditionally fermented in tanks, washed, and then carefully dried on patios or raised beds. At Bella Vista, careful attention is paid to each detail of processing and dry milling which enables better transparency for each micro lot. They use Grain Pro packaging to protect the coffee from less than ideal environments encountered during travel and storage.
Finca Semillero sits on 12.5 hectares of land where, for eleven years, they have cultivated their Tekisic variety, a close relative of classic Bourbon developed in El Salvador. The Zelaya family cultivates Caturra and Tekisic on about three hectares of the farm. Prior to the Zelayas purchase of this land, it was used to farm corn and beans.
The Zelaya familys commitment to maintaining coffee quality starts with the selection of the varieties planted and a focus on ecological stability. After being picked, the coffee from Finca Semillero is washed mechanically at the Zelaya familys Bella Vista Mill on the outskirts of Antigua. Special supervision during the wet and dry milling stages guarantees that only the best is selected for export.  Finally, they ship the green coffee in Grain Pro technology, which protects it from the less than ideal elements encountered during travel and storage.
In 2011, La Roya, also known as coffee leaf rust disease, severely affected Semillero. The Zelayas began a strict pruning and cultivation program to counteract the effects. They are renovating the coffee plants with extensive pruning in order to improve cherry productivity. Leguminose (beans) are being planted among the coffee plants as a natural fertilizer and other organic compost is being added to improve soil conditions on the farm.
Byron Ismael Marroquin now manages Semillero. He and the Zelayas are renovating their coffee plants with aggressive pruning and a stumping project while continuing to replace Catimor with Caturra and Tekisic varieties. They employed advanced soil analysis technologies to achieve the correct balance in the soil for their coffee to thrive. Theyre now able to detect the balance in the soil in real time, rather than waiting for the results of the harvest to know whether inputs worked.
The Zelaya family has recently planted more Tekisic on newly acquired land from their recent purchase of a neighbors farm. The cherries ripened evenly this year, which enabled them to pick the bulk of the harvest at once rather than making multiple sweeps through the farm. They dried the coffee at the Bella Vista mill on new raised beds.
Farm, process and mill coffee from the fabled Antigua region
The family coffee business is over 100 years old
Ricardo is making his operation even greener with a new technique to recycle the washing water.
Part of the famed Zelaya coffee family (and cousin to Luis Pedro Zelaya Jr), Ricardo is one of our favorite people in the world to visit. Along with his wife, Cynthia, Ricardo has an infectious laugh and brings a sense of joy to everything he does. No trip to his mill is complete without hopping on ATVs to tear up and down the hills.
In Antigua, beautiful 16th-century Mission architecture is framed by the three large, active volcanoes. Those same volcanoes give this region a rich soil, full of minerals and perfect for growing coffee. Ricardos mill is only about 15 minutes away from his cousin Luis; from either spot, you can often see the very active Volcan de Fuego (Volcano of Fire) which gives off ash and smoke nearly every day.
Ricardo is constantly investing and inventing  every time we visit, hes come up with a new, improved way to grow coffee. Whether its saving water, ensuring healthier coffee trees, coaching his neighbors on quality and variety, or devising a new system that pays pickers fast and fairly, his mill is always a bustle of activity.
Santa Clara, located in the southern slopes of the Antigua Valley between 1550-1800 meters above sea level, is privileged to have some of the finest volcanic soils for the cultivation of specialty coffee. Santa Clara won many awards for quality such as the Guatemala Cup of Excellence in 2001, 2009 and 2010.
Ricardo cultivates the coffee at the plantation under strictly controlled shade trees which allow the coffee plants to receive the ideal amount of sunshine required to produce fine and aromatic coffee. Bourbon, Caturra and Catuai varieties have been cultivated at Santa Clara for many years. For the last few years, Ricardo has conducted trials of Bourboncito (Bourbon 300). He has been gradually replacing most of the Catuai with either Bourbon or Bourboncito.
The hand-picked fruit is processed traditionally at Ricardos Santa Clara wet mill with crystal clear water. The beans are then patiently dried on tiered, raised beds with a greenhouse style enclosed canopy. The coffee is finally dry milled at either Bella Vista or Pulcal Mill. Every step in the mill is monitored constantly to maintain the quality. Each lot is cupped by two expert cuppers to assure it is up to quality standards.
Recently, Ricardo has been busy upgrading his processing techniques and infrastructure, including implementing a control system that ensures only high quality ripe cherry gets selected. He also installed new tiled tanks and channels to process his coffee using a unique technique to recycle the water, and built a raised bed structure which incorporates tiered beds within a greenhouse style canopy.
This family owned- and operated-farm grows the rare Villalobos variety
This is the third-generation of coffee production for the Torres family
The nine Torres siblings grow the rare Villalobos variety, which only exists in this area of Costa Rica and was first discovered by their grandfather. The family has been growing coffee for three generations; if youre lucky, family patriarch Olivier will be around to play traditional music on the hand-crafted guitars he makes in retirement.
The West Valley region of Costa Rica, besides being the only place on earth where you can find the sweet, floral Villalobos variety, is perfectly lush terrain for growing coffee. We always stop and load up on European-style hard cheeses at a fromagerie between the Torres farm and the Helsar de Zarcero micromill.
After six decades, the Torres siblings continue to innovate while never straying too far from the rigorous standards passed down through the years. Although they continue to be one of the worlds foremost producer of Villalobos, we are delighted that they are now experimenting with other exotic varieties, including the delicate and extraordinary Gesha variety.
The Torres family and Stumptown have developed a longstanding relationship, due to the impeccable quality and consistency of their Villalobos cultivar. As coffee producers, their attention to detail shines in the cultivation of their seedling nursery, the maintenance and nutrition of their coffee plants and in diligent cherry selection.
In the early 1950s, Juan Gonzalez and Salvador Torres pioneered coffee production in the small rural community of Barranca de Naranjo in the West Valley Region of Costa Rica. They began by planting Bourbon and Typica varieties on their small piece of land. Over the years, they discovered a new cultivar appearing on their land, Villalobos, a natural mutation of Typica first discovered in Costa Ricas West Valley town of Sarchi. 
Gonzalez and Torres observed how well the new cultivar was suited to the Barranca terroir and decided to reproduce it. They obtained lots of seedlings and built a nursery to increase production.
Salvadors son, Olivier Torres, inherited the farm and expanded the land to twelve hectares over many years of diligent work. The majority of farmers in the region replaced their Villalobos trees with higher yielding, more disease resistant varieties; but the Torres family decided to continue cultivating the original Villalobos variety due to its wonderful and unique cup profile. 
Truly a family operation, Oliviers three sons Jorge, Henry and Alvaro run the farm. Olivier now cultivates another passion: he makes handcrafted guitars in his workshop just above the terraced hillside where his father began a coffee producing tradition.
Today, the Torres family cultivates Villalobos on eight hectares of their farm, or 75% of their coffee crop; the rest consists of 20% Caturra and 5% Villa Sarchi. 
In order to continue renovating their crop land, 3,500 coffee trees were planted in 2013. A mixture of guava, inga and erythrina trees shade the farm, along with citrus trees and other fruit and vegetable crops. 
In 2013, the Torres family conducted an aggressive fertilization program that includes boron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, and other minerals determined by frequent leaf and soil analysis.
The Torres family brings their cherry to Helsar de Zarcero micro mill, located just up the hill in Llano Bonito de Naranjo, for processing. Ricardo Perez, Marvin Rodriguez and Phillip Rodriguez started Helsar in 2004 with the goal of providing traceability to the high quality coffee grown on their farms. 
Today, they process coffee from ten families in the small surrounding area. The mill is well known for sustainable practices such as making organic fertilizer onsite from coffee cherry pulp combined with molasses, mined zinc, boron and other minerals. Microorganisms are cultured from soil collected on nearby mountains and added to the fertilizer in order to provide disease protection to coffee plants. 
Helsar is deeply rooted in the local community and takes action to compensate for its carbon footprint by planting trees in a local biological reserve and using low impact Penagos machinery to process the coffee cherry.
Our Torres Villalobos was meticulously processed with 10% of the honey still intact after demucilaging. The parchment begins drying under a covered patio similar to a greenhouse then, if the weather permits, they move it to raised beds, or dry it in mechanical dryers.
Recently, the Torres family has utilized selective pruning to combat Roya which is present near their farm. The Helsar micromill also implemented a slower and more controlled drying process in order to increase the stability of the bean. They built additional raised beds and adjusted the time in the mechanical dryers by adding 2-4 hours of resting between twelve hour drying cycles to replicate evening cooling which naturally occurs outdoors.

Make perfect cold brew at home. Seriously caffeinated and super delicious.
We love the Filtron because its easy to use, consistent and makes a big batch of cold brew concentrate. The initial brew takes 12-24 hours, but youll be energetically thanking yourself for it later.


              Theres nothing better than cold brewed coffee on a hot summer day  or if youre like us, any day, really. Cold Brew coffee is naturally smooth and sweet and less acidic than coffee brewed with hot water. The Filtron Cold Water Brewer is a simple way to make several cups  of cold brew concentrate. Cold brewing takes between 12  24 hours (we recommend 16) but the payoff is huge. This batch should keep you buzzing for days. We recommend a ratio of 1:2 coffee concentrate to water over ice, adjusting to taste.

Hes constantly investing, inventing and innovating, and the payoff is clear  Santa Clara coffees have won Cups of Excellence in 2001, 2009 and 2010.
This coffee is grown in the shadow of three volcanoes  including the very active Fuego Volcano. The last time we visited, Fuego was spewing plumes of ash and the lava was flowing  its that same volcanic ash that contributes to the incredible minerality of the soil, and in turn, the beautiful fruitiness of the coffee.

This complex and sweet cup starts with a round, full cherry splash and finishes with warm chocolate and toffee flavors.

Named for a long-shuttered beauty parlor that housed the first Stumptown location, Hair Bender was the very first blend that Stumptown-founder Duane Sorenson introduced to the world. In fact, we still have the Hair Bender sign in our headquarters, watching over us as we roast each batch.
Its our most popular coffee with good reason. A cup of Hair Bender has clarity and complexity; Indonesias rich textures are balanced by the classic flavors of Latin America and Africa. We use it at our cafes for espresso, but its great for all brew methods.

A very remote area in Northern Peru with breathtaking landscapes that is a mecca for growing organic coffee. When we visit here, our producers always offer upon arrival a shot of homemade aguardiente, anise-flavored firewater booze that the locals make and store in plastic Coca-Cola liters. The coffee culture here is relatively new and the region is only just beginning to gain access to basic infrastructure, such as electricity and paved roads. For us, its worth the rugged trek  we find this region produces incredibly expressive organic coffees. 
Big brother to the Porlex mini, if there were such thing as a luxury hand grinder, this would be it. 
Like its smaller sibling, the JP-30 has a longer length and a bigger capacity to grind more coffee at once. Really easy to adjust, this guy is pretty speedy for a hand-grinder.

              Throughout history, people have roasted coffee beans over fires and in stoves. This is how we do it. 

            
Decaf shouldnt taste this good. But it does. In fact, it tastes great.
The sweetness of raisins pairs beautifully with caramel in this creamy, buttery cup.

We begin with meticulously sourced beans, choosing only those whose flavors and profiles can stand up to decaffeination. We make that process as gentle as possible with the Swiss Water Decaf process. Pioneered in the 1930s, this is the only certifiably organic way to remove caffeine. This process instead relies on hot water, osmosis, and an activated charcoal filter.
The result is a decaffeinated bean that still carries its own flavors and aromas; our blend brings a lightly sweet but full-bodied experience, and makes an outstanding espresso or cup of drip.

This father and son team grows, processes and educates at the best coffee-
growing operation in Guatemala and one of the top five in the world.
The Aguirres have opened their own roastery and coffee bar in Guatemala City to 
 showcase their coffee and train baristas.
The Aguirres set the bar in the world of coffee.
We could talk for hours about what theyve done for their community  building 
schools, clinics, safe worker housing, a tortilla factory to make sure everyone is fed, a 
microhydropower plant that powers not only the farm but the nearby village.
Year after year, we come to them for their impeccably balanced, complex coffee that 
hits on every level.
El Injerto is a seven-hour drive from Guatemala City, a bumpy, curvy van ride up over the mountains and down into a lush canyon. From the farm, you can see the Sierra Madre de Chiapas mountain range in Mexico.
From the seasonal pickers all the way up to Arturo Sr., everyone at El Injerto is focused on obsessively making the best coffee possible. 
Every day, they cup with their entire processing team, many of whom used to be pickers and have worked their way up through the organization. Theyll have mini-competitions with blind taste tests so see whos making the best coffee.
They also educate nearby farmers and the coffee world as a whole on sustainability, community engagement and the sense of what great coffee can be. Year after year, El Injerto wins Guatemalas Cup of Excellence award.
The relationship between Stumptown and Finca El Injerto is one of our strongest and longest. Arturo Aguirre, a 3rd generation coffee farmer, owns and operates the farm with his son, Arturo Jr. They run the farm with dedication to sustaining a coffee farming community and a meticulous approach to processing the highest quality coffee in Guatemala. The efforts of the Aguirre family, combined with our own, have improved the coffee year after year.
Mr. Jesus Aguirre Panama acquired the land in 1874 and planted corn, beans, tobacco, and sugarcane. Around 1900, he planted coffee and named the farm El Injerto after a native fruit that is similar to Zapote fruit and found only in this region. Three generations and over 100 years later, El Injerto has 245 hectares planted with coffee: 70% Bourbon, with the remaining mixed between Catuai, Maragogype, Pacamara, Tekisic, Mocca and Gesha varieties.
Arturo Jr. is working on some new projects which will greatly improve fermentation including building an additional fermentation tank, finishing tiling the entire washing area and tiling all of the tanks. Arturo Jr. conveys a huge sense of pride about their social programs. The family built new housing for their year round workers with the funds from their auction. Eight of the ten families received new homes. They built a new clinic, maintenance room and four newly installed showers and bathrooms for workers. The clinic has been a mainstay at El Injerto for years with a physician who visits every 15 days from the nearby town of La Democracia. They built a playground and nursery for the pickers kids, which will enable the pickers to have their children supervised and provide activities during harvest. Injerto also pays twice the hourly wage as their neighbors. An expectation of higher scrutiny in all things concerned with harvesting and processing comes with the higher wage. Some workers have found it too demanding, but this is what sets Injerto apart.
Since 1905, Finca El Injerto has produced exceptional coffee with a commitment to respecting and preserving the natural resources of the Huehuetenango region. More than half of Finca El Injerto is a thousand year old virgin forest that surrounds and protects the coffee plantation, preserving the delicate micro-climate required to grow exquisite Arabica coffee.
The Aguirres protect the quality of the land through sustainable agricultural methods. They use coffee parchment for fuel in the mechanical dryers. Water used in wet milling is filtered in ponds before returning to the rivers to avoid pollution downstream. Native species are replanted in reforestation efforts. They focus on the coffee plants tissue management system without the use of fungicides, herbicides or insecticides. They manage weeds strictly by machete. In order to assess the appropriate nutritional supplements for the plants, soil and leaf analysis takes place annually.  Worm culture technology breaks down the coffee cherry skin to produce lombricompost which becomes a fertilizer at the nursery and the final plantings. Shade trees are planted throughout the farm to promote air circulation and control the amount of sunlight received by the plants. El Injerto also has many social projects which promote the well-being and health of the workers and their families.
Arturo Sr. and Jr. ensure perfect cherry selection and utilize cherry flotation to sort by density. Disc depulpers remove the cherry prior to extended fermentation which can last up to 72 hours due to the cold typical of this altitude.  In 2013, they installed a pre-pulp separator to further minimize pulp contamination during fermentation. The coffee is then double washed and soaked. Patio pre-drying prepares the beans for a final low temperature drum drying. In order to better understand the coffee and all the nuances within their production, they have a cupping lab at the farm with four trained cuppers.
The Aguirres named the section of their farm where they cultivate Pacamara Pandoras Block. This block nourishes a sweet, balanced and floral variety. Pacamara, a hybrid of Pacas and Maragogype, creates a perfect marriage of Bourbon and Typica. Arturo Aguirre Sr. purchased their first Pacamara seeds from El Salvador where the variety originated. Pandoras Block consists of a mixture of old and new plants, averaging 18 years old. They renovate annually to maintain plant age diversity.
Three years ago, a hail storm swept through Huehuetenango and devastated half of the Aguirres Pacamara plants. The plants can take years to recover. Happily, this year, their production finally reached full volume.
After meticulously picking ripe cherry, they depulp it, dry ferment for 18-24 hours, and soak it for 24 hours in clean water. They dry this lot strictly on tiered raised beds.
Stumptown founder Duane Sorenson brought Gesha seeds to Arturo Aguirre Jr. years ago. Later in the same year, Arturo Sr. traveled to Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama and brought some more seeds directly from the Petersons. 
The Gesha seeds were planted in 2008 in a region of the farm with a high shade canopy called La Calaca. La Calaca translates as the skull. According to the people of the village, this area in the northwest part of the farm used to be where witches of the towns held rituals. They have even found animal skulls to offer as proof of their story. Seven different varieties are cultivated on the 12 hectare area of La Calaca. Workers on the farm believe they have transformed the rituals of those long ago witches into a good spell. They believe the coffee cultivated here will bewitch any who dares to drink it.
The staff at El Injerto is learning about the nuances of Gesha by constantly checking the crop throughout the growing season to see how it behaves and reacts within the microclimate in order to make important decisions about the tissue management. Each variety reacts differently from climate to climate, so it takes education, observation, and detailed management in order to perfect a particular variety.
The tiny lot of Gesha was treated with utmost care and detail. The Aguirres sent their finest pickers to select these cherry at the height of the harvest season. After depulping, this lot was dry fermented for 18-24 hours in perfectly clean conditions, moving the beans after each stage for uniform fermentation. The lot was then washed and soaked for 24 hours then dried on tiered, raised drying beds. They sorted this lot by hand twice, once during the parchment stage and then again just prior to export at the green bean stage. 
In 2014, the Aguirres built a micro hydroelectric power plant which provides electricity for the farm, mill and all of the housing (which includes workers housing). They purchased and distributed over 50 safer and more efficient gas cooking stoves to replace the less healthy wood stoves in their workers homes. They also continue to provide free food for all of their workers from their onsite tortilla factory. The Aguirre family plans to plant more Gesha. This year the Gesha dried on raised beds for the first time, rather than on patios.
Farming, processing and exporting classic Antiguan coffee
The family coffee business is over 100 years old
He is the cousin of Ricardo Zelaya
Among those who love Antiguan coffees, the Zelaya family is legendary. Luis represents the fourth generation of this tremendous legacy, and while he honors tradition, he also pushes Antiguan coffee toward the future. He constantly innovates and elevates quality levels, and is instrumental in making Antiguan Coffee a Protected Designation of Origin product, which places them alongside Champagne from the 45th parallel or prosciutto from southern Italy. Whenever he visits us in Portland, he always wants to stop by the Horse Brass Pub for a local microbrew.
Founded in 1527, Antigua is a regal place, having once been the capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala. It sits in the shadow of three volcanoes  including the very active Fuego Volcano. The last time we visited, Fuego was spewing plumes of ash and the lava was flowing  its that same volcanic ash that contributes to the incredible minerality of the soil, and in turn, the beautiful fruitiness of the coffee.
Luis is unique among our larger producers  he has taken coffee separation and made it a wonderfully meticulous art. He divides his coffee by farm, microclimate, location, date harvested and more  and keeps all of it separate through depulping, processing and drying. The result is an incredible variety of nuanced, distinct coffees with bright, sweet flavor.
Antigua, Guatemala is one of the most renowned coffee producing regions in the world due to its climate, altitude, fertile volcanic soils and farming practices. Antigua sits in a valley scattered with coffee farms surrounded by three volcanoes: Agua, Fuego and Acatenango.
Bella Vista is a farm, wet mill, and dry mill owned by the Zelaya family. With over 100 years of experience, the Zelaya family is committed to maintaining excellent quality coffee through ecologically stable and environmentally friendly methods.
Our Bella Vista consists of coffee from a combination of 100% Bourbon lots processed at Bella Vista, some grown by Zelaya himself and some grown by the Hunapu group.
Zelaya also instigated variety separation at Bella Vista farm, which fostered the ability for a lot consisting only of Villa Sarchi, a variety renown for sweetness and brightness. They improved their raised bed infrastructure by converting to three-tiered parabolic drying beds.
Hunapu, the local indigenous Cackchiquel word for the Volcano de Agua, is the name of a group of smallholder producers in the San Miguel Dueas and Ciudad Vieja microregions around Antigua who process their coffee at Bella Vista. Since 2006, Luis Pedro has worked with these farmers to develop meticulous lot separation with the ability to track lots from the farms, to the mill, to the warehouse and to their final destination. He brings his familys commitment to each family he works with for all the coffees milled at Bella Vista.
The Hunapu farmers deliver their red ripe coffee cherry to the Zelaya familys Bella Vista Mill to be processed and handled through export. Originally built in 1910, the mill had to be rebuilt after it was destroyed during the 1976 earthquake. This coffee is traditionally fermented in tanks, washed, and then carefully dried on patios or raised beds. At Bella Vista, careful attention is paid to each detail of processing and dry milling which enables better transparency for each micro lot. They use Grain Pro packaging to protect the coffee from less than ideal environments encountered during travel and storage.
Finca Semillero sits on 12.5 hectares of land where, for eleven years, they have cultivated their Tekisic variety, a close relative of classic Bourbon developed in El Salvador. The Zelaya family cultivates Caturra and Tekisic on about three hectares of the farm. Prior to the Zelayas purchase of this land, it was used to farm corn and beans.
The Zelaya familys commitment to maintaining coffee quality starts with the selection of the varieties planted and a focus on ecological stability. After being picked, the coffee from Finca Semillero is washed mechanically at the Zelaya familys Bella Vista Mill on the outskirts of Antigua. Special supervision during the wet and dry milling stages guarantees that only the best is selected for export.  Finally, they ship the green coffee in Grain Pro technology, which protects it from the less than ideal elements encountered during travel and storage.
In 2011, La Roya, also known as coffee leaf rust disease, severely affected Semillero. The Zelayas began a strict pruning and cultivation program to counteract the effects. They are renovating the coffee plants with extensive pruning in order to improve cherry productivity. Leguminose (beans) are being planted among the coffee plants as a natural fertilizer and other organic compost is being added to improve soil conditions on the farm.
Byron Ismael Marroquin now manages Semillero. He and the Zelayas are renovating their coffee plants with aggressive pruning and a stumping project while continuing to replace Catimor with Caturra and Tekisic varieties. They employed advanced soil analysis technologies to achieve the correct balance in the soil for their coffee to thrive. Theyre now able to detect the balance in the soil in real time, rather than waiting for the results of the harvest to know whether inputs worked.
The Zelaya family has recently planted more Tekisic on newly acquired land from their recent purchase of a neighbors farm. The cherries ripened evenly this year, which enabled them to pick the bulk of the harvest at once rather than making multiple sweeps through the farm. They dried the coffee at the Bella Vista mill on new raised beds.

Sit back and enjoy some of the amazing stories from Toby Smiths travels around the world in search of the most unique and interesting coffee. From Ethiopia and Yemen to Indonesia, Brazil, Costa Rica and many more exotic locations. Coffee Trailstraces the history, personalities and character of the worlds greatest coffee.
A few weeks ago on the blog we ventured to Tobys Smiths Farm, Finca Santa Teresa, for a truly rich Panama coffee experience. I mentioned in my previous post that I was working on a multi-part video series to capture the passion and hard work that goes into bringing our Tobys Estate coffee from the farm to your cup.
You may have already read parts of our recent trip to Panama for the 2014 coffee harvest, but I have been working behind the scenes to pull together a short video to give you a truly rich Panama coffee experience.
Here is a personal note from Paul Golding our Green Bean Buyer about his recent trip to Tobys Farm, Finca Santa Teresa.
Im not ordinarily big on bright gold and purple trousers but when in Coorg, do as the Coorgs do. Nithya, my friend whose wedding Im in India to celebrate trades coffee beans in Australia. His was a traditionally arranged marriage, but the wedding is in true Coorg style and Im determined to look the part.
Here is a personal note from one of our dedicated Roasters, Billy Ballard about his recent trip to Tobys Farm, Finca Santa Teresa.
Ghotul Akbar Nooruddin Abu al-Hasan al-Shadhili is the man who first bought coffee to the western world, but the guy who picks usp from the airport gives his name as Jack then takes us to the hotel without speaking.
The landscape is flat, the road is flat, the flatness stretches out forever and beyond. The only change in the landscape was colour, with brown moving to a light ochre, then opening up to a palette of red and green. The verdant hills are held up by the rich, red topsoil, all set off by a backdrop of impossibly blue sky.
1560 metres up, overlooking the pristine cooling rainforest punctuated by giant up-flung trees sits Finca Santa Teresa, the farm Ive dreamed of having since I got into the coffee game. Its great to be handed a bag of green beans, to roast them, grind them and so on. But being able to grow the fruit ourselves, to have a hand in that process, its another world.

Roasters Notes:This one continues to delight us all.  For the uninitiated, monsooning is a kind of curing or aging that produces huge, bold, punchy coffees with very low acidity.  Unfortunately, monsooning is a tricky process and can easily produce coffee with unpleasant musty or hessian-y taints, or, if the acidity is completely eliminated, can produce a coffee that just seems dead and flat in the cup.Our Aspinwall is the only IMM weve found that is consistently clean and as close to delicate as a monsooned coffee can get, with maple syrup and spice notes and that light-but-not-imperceptible acidity to lift it up. And then, of course, down below is that gigantic, velvety body that punches through milk and doesnt even mind a bit of sugar. Incongruous and mesmerising, like watching a hippo dance ballet. And who wouldnt want to watch that?Aroma: Maple Syrup, SpiceFlavours: Molasses, Maple Syrup, Intense, Very Heavy Body, Low AcidityCountry of Origin: IndiaRegion: Malabar CoastGrowing Altitude: 1100 MASLVarieties: Kent, S795, CauweryHarvest and processing: Washed, Monsooned

Roasters Notes:A classic Kenyan with a little extra punch, Malimbe is rich and big-bodied, with aromas of orange peel and bourbon along with a long, cocoa finish. Big enough for milk but also complex and well-balanced for black, Malimbe is one of our favourites and were excited to be able to offer it again. Full, rich tones of toffee, chocolate and bourbon at the bottom end are matched by distinct notes of citrus and blackberry on top.

Roaster's Notes: This coffee is a true labour of love  a blend of the very best washed, natural and honey-processed lots from Toby's farm, Finca Santa Teresa, carefully selected each season by Toby and his team. Intensely sweet, complex and rich, La Trinidad proffers base flavours of hazelnut, butterscotch and vanilla and a lovely, silky body. Mid palate notes of cocoa and guava give excellent presence in milk, and on top, sparkling red berry and mandarin acidity provides focus and backbone. A beautiful coffee flower aroma adds finesse and elegance, rounding out what we believe is the perfect drop.Aroma:Guava, Hazelnut, CinnamonFlavours: Vanilla, Butterscotch, Red Berry, MandarinCountry of Origin:PanamaRegion: ChiriquiGrowing Altitude: 1550 MASLVarieties: Caturra, CatuaiHarvest and Processing: Natural, Honey, Fully Washed
